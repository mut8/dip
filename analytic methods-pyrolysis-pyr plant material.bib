abstract = {The pyrolysis of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) of the cultivar, "Cave-in-Rock" harvested at three stages of physiological maturity was studied in a PY-GC/MS system at the 600-1050 degrees C temperature range. Under these conditions, the decomposition was complete within 20 s yielding char, and two sets of pyrolysis gas, condensable and non-condensable. The former consisted of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and higher molecular weight compounds possibly from the hydroxyl group and from the methoxy groups of the cell wall components. The non-condensable gases were mainly CO, CO2 and C-1-C-3 hydrocarbons. For these, there was a 900 degrees C temperature boundary where dramatic change occurred in their evolution rates. Below this temperature, CO2 decreased but CO and the C-1-C-3 hydrocarbons increased almost linearly with temperature. Above this temperature boundary, the hydrocarbons leveled off but there was a rapid rise in CO and CO2 evolution at a constant CO/CO2 ratio. These suggest the appearance of secondary or tertiary pyrolysis reactions involving rearrangement and release of CO and hydrocarbons prior to this temperature boundary and the release of CO and CO2 from the tightly bond oxygen functionalities including C-C bonds thereafter. At \&lt;750 degrees C, there were modest increases in condensable gas yield and decrease in non-condensable gas due to differences in plant maturity at harvest. However, the effect of switchgrass physiological maturity on gas yield was statistically insignificant at high temperatures. The energy content of the non-condensable gas measured was about 68\% of the gross energy content of the biomass for the early harvest crop and 80\% for the mature crop. The activation energy for the decomposition, estimated assuming first order reaction kinetics, showed a linear increase with plant physiological maturity. The results demonstrate that physiological maturity at harvest of switchgrass biomass can result in different concentrations of pyrolysis products at different temperatures. These results also demonstrate the need for additional research with a broader array of herbaceous biomass materials to develop a better understanding of the synergies of crop cultivation, harvesting and processing of dedicated herbaceous biomass energy crops during their thermochemical conversion.

abstract = {The chemical composition of leaf fibers of abaca (Musa textilis), which are commonly used for high-quality paper pulp production, was thoroughly studied. The results revealed that the lignin content was 13.2\% of the total fiber. The analysis of abaca fibers by pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) released predominantly compounds arising from lignin and p-hydroxycinnamic acids, with high amounts of 4-vinylphenol. The latter compound was demonstrated to arise from p-coumaric acid by pyrolysis of abaca fibers in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide, which released high amounts of p-coumaric acid (as the methyl derivative). Products from p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) propanoid units, with a predominance of the latter (H:G:S molar ratio of 1.5:1:4.9), were also released after Py-GC/MS of abaca fibers. Sinapyl and coniferyl acetates, which are thought to be lignin monomer precursors, were also found in abaca. The extractives content of the abaca fiber (0.4\%) was low, and the most predominant compounds were free sterols (24\% of total extract) and fatty acids (24\% of total extract). Additionally, significant amounts of steroid ketones (10\%), triglycerides (6\%), omega-hydroxyfatty acids (6\%), monoglycerides (4\%), fatty alcohols (4\%), and a series of p-hydroxycinnamyl (p-coumaric and ferulic acids) esterified with long chain alcohols and omega-hydroxyfatty acids were also found, together with minor amounts of steroid hydrocarbons, diglycerides, alpha-hydroxyfatty acids, sterol esters, and sterol glycosides.},

@article{Reeves1997,
abstract = {Forages and by-products, such as stovers and hulls, are important ruminant feedstuffs. Considerable effort is expended on composition determination, including research to better understand the relationship between composition and utilization by ruminants. Most of the procedures used are empirical in nature and make such determinations difficult at best. For example, the primary procedures used to determine a forage's potential feeding value are based on fiber determinations using extractive procedures. While it is possible to chemically analyze feedstuffs in a non-empirical fashion, the analyses required are so time consuming and extensive as to be generally impractical. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS), on the other hand, is simple to carry out and generates no waste, while being capable of simultaneously providing information on the composition of many or all of the feedstuff constituents. Research has demonstrated that PY-GC/MS can provide detailed information on constituents such as lignin, tannins, carbohydrates, etc. The information provided has been shown to be useful in determining the basis for wet chemical procedures (i.e. what exactly does a procedure determine), in differentiating subtle differences in composition between varieties of the same plant species, and in comparing the overall composition of one material to another. Finally, PY-GC/MS can be a tremendous tool for the determination of forage and by-product composition which has until now been largely ignored by animal nutritionists and forage researchers.

@article{Buurman2010,
abstract = {To investigate both the effect of land-use systems on SOM characteristics and the effect of occlusion in aggregates on chemical composition of the occluded fraction, SOM fractions of soils under Cerrado, no-tillage and conventional tillage, were investigated. Free light, occluded light and extractable organic matter from native Cerrado and from tilled and untilled fields under maize and bean rotation were separated and chemically analysed by pyrolysis-GC/MS. Ploughing incorporated more fresh OM into the soil than natural biological activity. Degradation of the occluded light fraction was not fully halted, but was different from that of SOM in the extractable fraction. Recalcitrant compounds had low abundances in the free light and extracted fractions, but were more abundant in the occluded light fraction, where the more accessible compounds were depleted by microbial decomposition. Because of intense decomposition, the extracted fractions did not differentiate between land uses, but differences in the light fractions were significant. The results indicate that the decay of the occluded fraction is different from that of the free light fraction: non-ideal circumstances of decay caused a relative accumulation of potentially recalcitrant compounds. When considering the rapid turnover of all components in the soil extracts, disruption of aggregates will probably cause rapid decay of the occluded fraction. The distribution of pyrolysis products that can be ascribed to charred wood (polyaromatics) indicates that this fraction is readily decayed if not occluded. Selective decomposition in the occluded fraction may cause a shift in delta 13C that should not be misinterpreted.},

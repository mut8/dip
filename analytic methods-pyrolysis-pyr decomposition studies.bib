abstract = {Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) using a vertical furnace pyrolyzer was applied to the characterization of internal wood degradation in Platanus acerifolia. Wood disks from approximately 92-year-old tree, previously cut down and showing a large infection caused by wood-rotting fungi, were analysed to determine lignin pyrolysis products composition and syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio. Similar phenolic compounds were found in the sound and extensively degraded wood, as well as in wood samples collected in R-zone, which separate sound and decayed wood. Significant variation of S/G ratio versus wood degradation, instead, was observed. The values showed a decrease of 27.1\% from sound to decayed wood revealing a structural fungal degradation of lignin. Furthermore, a less extensive drop (13.7\%) of S/G ratio in the R-zone, in comparison with the sound wood, was observed. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the relative peak areas of the 23 identified pyrolysis products. The differentiation between sound and decayed wood was observed in the plot of the two first components as well as the correlation between pyrolysis products was discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {During microbial breakdown of leaf litter a fraction of the C lost by the litter is not released to the atmosphere as CO(2) but remains in the soil as microbial byproducts. The amount of this fraction and the factors influencing its size are not yet clearly known. We performed a laboratory experiment to quantify the flow of C from decaying litter into the soil, by means of stable C isotopes, and tested its dependence on litter chemical properties. Three sets of (13)C-depleted leaf litter (Liquidambar styraciflua L., Cercis canadensis L. and Pinus taeda L.) were incubated in the laboratory in jars containing (13)C-enriched soil (i.e. formed C4 vegetation). Four jars containing soil only were used as a control. Litter chemical properties were measured using thermogravimetry (Tg) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-combustion interface-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS-C-IRMS). The respiration rates and the delta(13)C of the respired CO(2) were measured at regular intervals. After 8 months of incubation, soils incubated with both L. styraciflua and C. canadensis showed a significant change in delta(13)C (delta(13)C(final) = -20.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand and -19.5 +/- 0.5 per thousand, respectively) with respect to the initial value (delta(13)C(initial) = -17.7 +/- 0.3 per thousand); the same did not hold for soil incubated with P. taeda (delta(13)C(final:)-18.1 +/- 0.5 per thousand). The percentages of litter-derived C in soil over the total C loss were not statistically different from one litter species to another. This suggests that there is no dependence of the percentage of C input into the soil (over the total C loss) on litter quality and that the fractional loss of leaf litter C is dependent only on the microbial assimilation efficiency. The percentage of litter-derived C in soil was estimated to be 13 +/- 3\% of total C loss.},

abstract = {Changes in organic composition of crop residues (soybean, radish, white lupine, blue lupine, black oat and mucuna) that are utilized in crop rotations in no-tillage farming systems in the southern part of Brazil were evaluated by analytical flash. pyrolysis. The pyrolysis allowed the identification of five groups of compounds ill the residues: guaiacyl moieties in lignin (Lg), syringyl moities in lignin (Ls), polysaccharide (Ps), chlorophyll (Chl) and fatty acid (Fa) derivatives. The decomposition :rates of the plant residues ranged from 4.7 to 5.9 g kg(-1) day(-1), with a mean value of 5.2 g kg(-1) day(-1), corresponding to a mean loss of 41\% (37-47\%) of the initial biomass after 80 days of incubation. The Ps and lignin contents were strongly affected by incubation; relative lignin content increased at the expense of polysaccharide derivatives. In the original samples, Ps was the principal group of organic compounds in green manure plant materials, with maximum values in blue and white lupine (67\%); after incubation, Ps fractions decreased by 26-51\%, (average 40\%), with the greatest value observed with mucuna and the lowest in white lupine. In soybean plant material the Ps fraction decreased only by 9\%. Greater increases in relative lignin content were observed with Ls (156\%) than with Lg (59\%) derivatives, demonstrating that guaiacyl moieties are easier to biochemically degrade than syringyl moieties. A significant correlation between residue-weight loss and organic groups after 80 days incubation was only found with Ls. Plant materials showing a higher content of syringyl moieties after decomposition might aid ill increasing soil organic matter. Flash pyrolysis was shown to be an adequate technique to follow the process of transformation of plant residues into stabilized soil organic matter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

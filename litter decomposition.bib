@article{DAnnunzio2008,
abstract = {A multi-site and multi-age set of in situ N-15-labelled litter decomposition experiments was carried out in various European beech forests. The sites presented contrasted situations of climate and humus type that were representative of northern Europe temperate forests. N-15-labelled leaf litter was produced by urea spraying in an experimental beech plot, and was used in litter decomposition experiments over a 3-6-year period, depending on the site. Schemes of decomposition covered a wide range of situations, some of them not expected, like high decay rate on Moder humus forms or slow decomposition on Mull humus form. The objectives of this study were to determine how nitrogen release and/or incorporation rates could characterize litter decomposition dynamics. A carbon and nitrogen coupled model of decomposition based on the quality theory was used to fit the given data. High correlation coefficients and unbiased fitting were obtained both for carbon (R-2 = 0.96,p \&lt;= 0.0001, n = 392) and nitrogen (R-2 = 0.86,p \&lt;= 0.0001, n = 367). The theoretical concept of quality was somewhat lightened and related to decomposer activity: low rates of quality decrease were associated with high decomposition rates, showing that when decomposers are sufficiently supplied with labile carbon from the humus they decompose litter more completely than when they are carbon limited. Provided that the degrading substrate stoichiometry was kept constant (i.e. C loss / N loss ratio), the same litter decomposition could be processed at different rates. Taking seasonal variations of the parameters into account is likely to improve our understanding, but further experiments at more frequent intervals are needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To investigate whether lignin transformations are influenced by mineral phases, an incubation experiment with mixtures of beech leaf litter and Fe oxide, Al hydroxide, or birnessite was conducted. Fe oxide reduced lignin decomposition to 39\% of the lignin initially present as compared to 50\% in the control, whereas in the Al hydroxide experiment only 11\% of the lignin was degraded. Lignin side chain oxidation was enhanced in the presence of Fe oxide and birnessite. The most important properties of the mineral phases, with respect to their influence on lignin transformations, are their effect on microbial availability of organic matter and their ability to oxidize organic compounds.},

@article{Snajdr2011a,
abstract = {The links among the changes in litter chemistry, the activity of extracellular enzymes and the microbial community composition were observed in Quercus petraea litter. Three phases of decomposition could be distinguished. In the early 4-month stage, with high activities of $\beta$-glucosidase, $\beta$-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase, 16.4\% of litter was decomposed. Hemicelluloses were rapidly removed while cellulose and lignin degradation was slow. In months 4-12, with high endocellulase and endoxylanase activities, decomposition of cellulose prevailed and 31.8\% of litter mass was lost. After the third phase of decomposition until month 24 with high activity of ligninolytic enzymes, the litter mass loss reached 67.9\%. After 2 years of decay, cellulose decomposition was almost complete and most of the remaining polysaccharides were in the form of hemicelluloses. Fungi largely dominated over bacteria as leaf endophytes and also in the litter immediately before contact with soil, and this fungal dominance lasted until month 4. Bacterial biomass (measured as phospholipid fatty acid content) in litter increased with time but also changed qualitatively, showing an increasing number of Actinobacteria. This paper shows that the dynamics of decomposition of individual litter components changes with time in accordance with the changes in the microbial community composition and its production of extracellular enzymes.},

@article{Reeves1997,
abstract = {Forages and by-products, such as stovers and hulls, are important ruminant feedstuffs. Considerable effort is expended on composition determination, including research to better understand the relationship between composition and utilization by ruminants. Most of the procedures used are empirical in nature and make such determinations difficult at best. For example, the primary procedures used to determine a forage's potential feeding value are based on fiber determinations using extractive procedures. While it is possible to chemically analyze feedstuffs in a non-empirical fashion, the analyses required are so time consuming and extensive as to be generally impractical. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS), on the other hand, is simple to carry out and generates no waste, while being capable of simultaneously providing information on the composition of many or all of the feedstuff constituents. Research has demonstrated that PY-GC/MS can provide detailed information on constituents such as lignin, tannins, carbohydrates, etc. The information provided has been shown to be useful in determining the basis for wet chemical procedures (i.e. what exactly does a procedure determine), in differentiating subtle differences in composition between varieties of the same plant species, and in comparing the overall composition of one material to another. Finally, PY-GC/MS can be a tremendous tool for the determination of forage and by-product composition which has until now been largely ignored by animal nutritionists and forage researchers.

@article{Fahey2011,
abstract = {We used sugar maple litter double-labeled with C-13 and N-15 to quantify fluxes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) between litter and soil in a northern hardwood forest and the retention of litter C and N in soil. Two cohorts of litter were compared, one in which the label was preferentially incorporated into non-structural tissue and the other structural tissue. Loss of C-13 from this litter generally followed dry mass and total C loss whereas loss of N-15 (20-30\% in 1 year) was accompanied by large increases of total N content of this decaying litter (26-32\%). Enrichment of C-13 and N-15 was detected in soil down to 10-15 cm depth. After 6 months of decay (November-May) 36-43\% of the C-13 released from the litter was recovered in the soil, with no differences between the structural and non-structural labeled litter. By October the percentage recovery of litter C-13 in soil was much lower (16\%). The C released from litter and remaining in soil organic matter (SOM) after 1 year represented over 30 g C m(-2) y(-1) of SOM accumulation. Recovery of litter N-15 in soil was much higher than for C (over 90\%) and in May N-15 was mostly in organic horizons whereas by October it was mostly in 0-10 cm mineral soil. A small proportion of this N was recovered as inorganic N (2-6\%). Recovery of N-15 in microbial biomass was higher in May (13-15\%) than in October (about 5\%). The C:N ratio of the SOM and microbial biomass derived from the labeled litter was much higher for the structural than the non-structural litter and for the forest floor than mineral SOM, illustrating the interactive role of substrates and microbial activity in regulating the C:N stoichiometry of forest SOM formation. These results for a forest ecosystem long exposed to chronically high atmospheric N deposition (ca. 10 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) suggest possible mechanisms of N retention in soil: increased organic N leaching from fresh litter and reduced fungal transport of N from soil to decaying litter may promote N stabilization in mineral SOM even at a relatively low C:N ratio.},

abstract = {Litter decay rates are often correlated with the initial lignin:N or lignin:cellulose content of litter, suggesting that interactions between lignin and more labile compounds are important controls over litter decomposition. The chemical composition of lignin may influence these interactions, if lignin physically or chemically protects labile components from microbial attack. We tested the effect of lignin chemical composition on litter decay in the field during a year-long litterbag study using the model system Arabidopsis thaliana. Three Arabidopsis plant types were used, including one with high amounts of guaiacyl-type lignin, one with high aldehyde- and p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignin, and a wild type control with high syringyl-type lignin. The high aldehyde litter lost significantly more mass than the other plant types, due to greater losses of cellulose, hemicellulose, and N. Aldehyde-rich lignins and p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignins have low levels of cross-linking between lignins and polysaccharides, supporting the hypothesis that chemical protection of labile polysaccharides and N is a mechanism by which lignin controls total litter decay rates. 2D NMR of litters showed that lignin losses were associated with the ratio of guaiacyl-to-p-hydroxyphenyl units in lignin, because these units polymerize to form different amounts of labile- and recalcitrant-linkages within the lignin polymer. Different controls over lignin decay and polysaccharide and N decay may explain why lignin:N and lignin:cellulose ratios can be better predictors of decay rates than lignin content alone.},

abstract = {The factors determining the quantity of litter being incorporated into stable organic matter were examined as part of a broader study investigating carbon (C) sequestration in forest ecosystems. Litter was collected from 20 common oak (Quercus robur L.) stands in Wales (UK) and placed in litter-decomposition bags. These bags were installed in an oak stand for 3, 6, 12, 21, and 31 months to study the effect of litter quality on decomposition (mass loss) rates and the limit value for a broad-leaf species. Results indicate that the initial decomposition rate is highly correlated with the manganese content of the litter (P = 0.007, R2 = 0.34). In the final stages of decomposition, limit values ranged between 57\% and 95\% of initial litter mass. These estimated limit values were not significantly correlated with initial concentrations of other nutrients. However, Ca concentrations gave a significance level of P = 0.067. Estimated rates of C sequestration in soil ranged from 0.93 to 80.22 g Cm2year1.},

@article{Eatherall2000,
abstract = {A dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sampling study was carried out on the River Swale in Yorkshire as part of the NERC LOIS programme. Loads of DOC were calculated from the river and its tributaries. For the River Swale calculated loads varied between 1900 and 9000 kg/day and for the tributaries between 1 and 8500 kg/day. No relationship was found between the amount of organic carbon in the soil of the catchments and the DOC loads, perhaps because of the preceding dry summer. DOC loads were also estimated for sewage point sources and ranged between 7 and 287 kg/day. Some of the catchments draining to the River Swale respond with high DOC loads during high flow conditions, others do not. Some catchments are dominated by sewage point sources during low flows and diffuse sources during high flows. A mass balance for DOC on the River Swale was calculated, however, loads from inputs did not balance with outputs because of a lack of data and errors inherent in some of the approaches used. Despite this, results indicate in-stream losses of approximately 20\%. A highly detailed measurement study of a stretch of river is recommended to identify all the sources and sinks of DOC, the relative size of their contribution and how they respond in differing conditions.},

abstract = {This study aims to investigate the state of the riverine organic carbon in the Luodingjiang River under human impacts, such as reforestation, construction of reservoirs and in-stream damming. Seasonal and spatial characteristics of total suspended sediment (TSS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), as well as C/N ratios and the stable carbon isotopic signatures of POC (delta(13)C(POC)) were examined based on a one-year study (2005) in the basin-wide scale. More frequent sampling was conducted in the outlet of the river basin at Guanliang hydrological station. DOC and POC concentrations showed flush effects with increasing water discharge and sediment load in the basin-wide scale. Atomic C/N ratio of POC had a positive relationship with TSS in the outlet of the basin, indicating the reduced aquatic sources and enhanced terrestrial sources during the high flood season. However, the similar relationship was not observed in the basin-wide scale mainly due to the spatial distributions of soil organic carbon and TSS. delta(13)C(POC) showed obvious seasonal variations with enriched values in the period with high TSS concentration, reflecting the increased contribution from C(4) plants with enhanced soil erosion. The specific flux of the total organic carbon (2.30 t km(-)(2) year(-1)) was smaller than the global average level. The ratio of DOC to POC was 1.17, which is higher than most rivers under Asian monsoon climate regime. The organic carbon flux was estimated to decline with decreasing sediment load as a result of reforestation, reservoir construction and in-stream damming, which demonstrates the impacts of human disturbances on the global carbon cycle.},

abstract = {The role of organic and minerogenic acidity in controlling pH levels in Finnish rivers was studied by measuring total organic carbon (TOC) and non-marine sulphate (*SO(4)) concentrations in river water of the main river basins and their sub-basins. The basins are located along a latitudinal gradient (60 degrees N to 69 degrees N) and cover 297,322 km(2), 88\% of the total area of Finland. The basins are predominately covered by coniferous forests and peatlands, and are located in areas with low sulphate deposition (80-430 mg S m(-2) a(-1)). The proportion of the basin covered by forests on mineral soils ranges from 29 to 64\% and the proportion of peatlands from 3 to 60\%. The percentage of peatland is highest in northern Finland (28-60\%), whereas the proportion of forests on mineral soils increases towards the south. The majority of the agricultural land is located in southern and western Finland. *SO(4) concentrations were positively correlated with the proportion of agricultural land in the basin. Moreover, the percentage of peatlands had a positive correlation with the concentrations of TOC and organic anion. High peatland proportion and high TOC and organic anion concentrations decreased pH values in the river water, whereas no correlation between *SO(4) concentrations and pH was observed. The average organic anion concentration exceeded the average *SO(4) concentration in river water in 17 basins out of the 86 studied basins. The organic anion-dominated areas were situated in northern basins, reflecting the high extent of peatlands in these areas. *SO(4) dominated in southern Finland and in western coastal areas, where the extent of agricultural land, acid sulphate soils and the deposition of sulphate is highest.},

This work deals with the characterization and quantification of Al, Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb, Si, NO(3)(-) and organic carbon transported from the continent to the sea by a small coastal river in the French Mediterranean area. Transported species were characterized both during rainy and dry periods. During non-rainy periods (base-flow), waters showed a low content of contaminants, whereas during heavy rain events, following dry periods, some metals and organic carbon reached concentrations that could affect biological populations. These contaminants were mainly found in the particulate fraction, originating from the runoff of surface waters, which represents the main process of pollution in urban areas.},

The major compounds detected were tetrachlorobenzene, HCHs, chlordane, aldrin, DDDs, DDEs and DDTs. Total concentrations of pesticides in the sediments ranged from not detectable to 23 ng g(-1), with the maximum value detected near the discharge point of the marine outfall from the Pali sewage treatment plant. These results confirm that pesticides persist in estuarine and nearby coastal environments of the Danshui River well after their ban. Concentrations of total pesticides significantly correlate with concentrations of total organic carbon and black carbon in these sediments, suggesting that total organic carbon and black carbon regulate the distribution of trace organic pollutants in fluvial and coastal marine sediments.},

abstract = {Forty surface and twenty-two deeper sediment samples were collected from the Beijiang River and analyzed to acquire information about the levels, distribution, possible sources and influencing factors of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the Beijiang River. Our results showed that the most abundant BDE congeners in surface sediments were BDE47, 99 and 209, with a median value of 0.044, 0.03, and 5.22 ng g(-1), respectively. The levels of BDE209 in our samples were much higher relative to those of the other BDE congeners and made up more than 90\% of the PBDEs levels in almost all samples. Disregarding BDE209, of the remaining 9 BDE congeners the most abundant ones were BDE47 and 99, which contributed 35.7\% and 24.6\%, respectively, to the median of the 9 congeners. The contribution of the Beijiang River to the PBDE pollution burden of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) was small in comparison to that of the Dongjiang River and the Guangzhou section of the Zhujiang River. PBDEs in the Beijiang River mainly came from use of deca-BDE and penta-BDE with a minor contribution of octa-BDE. The poor correlation between PBDE and TOC may indicate that PBDEs concentrations in the sediments of the Beijiang River were controlled not only by TOC contents, but also by a combined effect of transport, mixing, depositional mechanisms associated with PBDEs, uncontaminated sediments, or fresh input of PBDEs.},

@article{Uncles2000,
abstract = {Data are presented for particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) concentrations in the Humber Estuary and tidal River Ouse Estuary. The POC data were derived from approximately monthly surveys and are consistent with data reported for suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the non-tidal River Ouse (the freshwater river) and with SPM, or bed sediments, in estuarine ecosystems such as the Mississippi, Delaware, San Francisco Bay, Tolo Harbour, the Vellar Estuary and Cochin Backwater, as well as the Loire, Gironde, Ems and Tamar Estuaries. Relative to the dry weight of SPM, the Humber-averaged organic carbon and nitrogen percentages during the year February 1995-March 1996 were 2.6 +/- 0.6\% (mean and S.D.) and 0.21 +/- 0.04\%, respectively. The ratio of Humber-averaged POC to Humber-averaged PN was 13 +/- 3. Higher POC levels were observed near the Humber's mouth and in the adjacent coastal zone during 'bloom' conditions, and in the upper estuarine reaches during large, winter and springtime freshwater inflows. At these times of high runoff, the POC content of SPM increased progressively up-estuary from the coastal zone to the tidal River Ouse. When inflows became very low, during late spring to early autumn of 1995, both the freshwater-saltwater interface (FSI) and the strengthening turbidity maximum (TM) moved further up-estuary and the POC content of SPM in the upper reaches of the Ouse became lower compared with that immediately down-estuary. This led to a poorly defined POC maximum near the confluence of the Humber, Ouse and Trent, before POC eventually decreased again towards the coastal zone. The lower POC contents in the upper estuarine reaches of the tidal Ouse may have been partly due to POC respiration by heterotrophic bacteria attached to SPM within the TM, consistent with the severe oxygen depletion observed there during high turbidity, summertime spring tides.},

abstract = {We examined chemical changes from leaf tissue to soil organic matter (SOM) to determine the persistence of plant chemistry into soil aggregate fractions. We characterized a slow (Dicranopteris linearis) and fast-decomposing species (Cheirodendron trigynum) and surface (O), and subsurface (A-horizon) SOM beneath each species using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS), with and without derivatization. The live tissues of Dicranopteris had greater lignin content whereas Cheirodendron had a greater lipid, N-bearing, and polysaccharide component. Despite this difference in leaf chemistry, SOM chemistry was similar between soil aggregate fractions, but different between horizons. The O-horizon contained primarily lignin and polysaccharide biomarkers whereas the A-horizon contained polysaccharide, aromatic, and N-derived compounds, indicating considerable microbial processing of plant litter. The soils beneath Cheirodendron inherited a greater lipid signal composed of cutin and suberin biomarkers whereas the soils beneath Dicranopteris contained greater aromatic biomarker content, possibly derived from plant lignins. The soils beneath both species were more similar to root polysaccharides, lipids, and lignins than aboveground tissue. This study indicates that although plant-derived OM is processed vigorously, species-specific biomarkers and compound class differences persist into these soils and that differences in plant chemical properties may influence soil development even after considerable reworking of plant litter by microorganisms.},

abstract = {Radiocarbon (14C) dating of total soil organic matter (SOM) often yields results inconsistent with the stratigraphic sequence. The onerous chemical extractions for SOM fractions do not always produce satisfactory 14C dates. In an effort to develop an alternative method, the pyrolysis-combustion technique was investigated to partition SOM into pyrolysis volatile (Py-V) and pyrolysis residue (Py-R) fractions. The Py-V fractions obtained from a thick glacigenic loess succession in Illinois yielded 14C dates much younger but more reasonable than the counterpart Py-R fractions for the soil residence time. Carbon isotopic composition 13C) was heavier in the Py-V fractions, suggesting a greater abundance of carbohydrate- and protein-related constituents, and 13C was lighter in the Py-R fractions, suggesting more ligninand lipid-related constituents. The combination of 14C dates and 13C values indicates that the Py-V fractions are less biodegradation resistant and the Py-R fractions are more biodegradation resistant. The pyrolysis-combustion method provides a less cumbersome approach for 14C dating of SOM fractions. With further study, this method may become a useful tool for analyzing unlithified terrestrial sediments when macrofossils are absent.},

abstract = {This work is part of a research program with the general objective of evaluating soil sustainability in areas surrounding hydroelectric reservoirs, which have been planted with riparian forest. The specific aims were: (i) to assess if and how the soil organic matter (SOM) chemical composition has changed in such areas, and (ii) to contribute to the knowledge of SOM chemistry in Brazil. To this end, we sampled litter and soil (Anionic Acrustox) in two adjacent areas: one under native vegetation and another forested with riparian species in 1992. The native vegetation was Brazilian savannah orcerrado. In this case, it was a ‘grassy cerrado’, dominated by grasses with few shrubs. Litter was collected and humic substances were extracted from soil by an alkaline solution. Both were characterised by a combination of cross-polarisation-magic angle spinning (CPMAS) solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and pyrolysis-gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Eight years after forestation, the addition of the forest litter had changed SOM chemical composition. The C input pattern exerted a key role on the observed alterations. In the grassy cerrado, litter addition is predominantly below-ground and the litter is richer in carbohydrate-derived compounds and poorer in lignin moieties. In the forested area, C input is largely above-ground and grass litter has been partially replaced by a relatively more recalcitrant material. As a result, topsoil under forest was chemically strongly different from that under cerrado. Factor analysis indicated that the largest differences were between topsoil under forest and deepest subsoil under cerrado, where there is influence of remaining cerrado-derived C. Both semi-quantification and factor analysis of pyrolysis data gave further insight on the extent of alterations, but more research on such a quantitative approach should be developed to detail its application in SOM studies.},

abstract = {Humic acids have been widely investigated by spectroscopic methods. especially NMR and FTIR, and they are known to show significant differences according to their origin. Low resolution methods such as NMR and FTIR. however cannot easily distinguish different input sources or establish relations between SOM chemistry and vegetation or land use in general. High resolution methods, such as analytical pyrolysis and pyrolysis combined with methylation do offer such possibilities. Therefore, HAs from five reference soils called the Eurosoils, including a Vertic Cambisol (E1, Italy), a Rendzina (E2, Greece), a Dystic Cambisol (E3, Great Britain), an Orthic Luvisol (E4, France) and an Orthic Podzol (E5, Germany), that were previously characterized a.o. by NMR, FTIR and ESR, were also analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) and subsequent analysis by GC/MS. The Orthic Podzol sample showed the largest aliphaticity, and the strongest degradation of aliphatics and lignin. The Dystric Cambisol featured the least decomposed HA, which was reflected by a large content of long-chain alkanes, and little lignin degradation. Both the Dystric Cambisol and the Orthic Luvisol HAs contained a significant amount of microbial organic matter. Polyaromatics, which indicate the presence of charred material, were most abundant in the Vertic Cambisol and the Podzol HAs and lowest in the Dystric Cambisol and the Rendzina HAs. THM was able to distinguish between the various vegetations/land uses. Although quantifications by NMR and py-GC/MS are essentially different, the general results largely coincided. NMR appears to underestimate aromaticity and overestimate aliphaticity, but a molecular mixing model yielded reasonable correlations between NMR and pyrolysis data. Classification by 'degradation state' based on py-GC/MS largely coincided with acidity determined by titration, but FTIR data did not coincide. Py-GC/MS, with its much larger resolution, is a better tool to distinguish effects of vegetation, microbial input, and degradation. HA's produce the same variety of compounds upon pyrolysis as total SOM extracts and are therefore chemically not more simple than SOM. HA chemistry, however can be understood in the light of land use history and SOM dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of leaf fibers of abaca (Musa textilis), which are commonly used for high-quality paper pulp production, was thoroughly studied. The results revealed that the lignin content was 13.2\% of the total fiber. The analysis of abaca fibers by pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) released predominantly compounds arising from lignin and p-hydroxycinnamic acids, with high amounts of 4-vinylphenol. The latter compound was demonstrated to arise from p-coumaric acid by pyrolysis of abaca fibers in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide, which released high amounts of p-coumaric acid (as the methyl derivative). Products from p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) propanoid units, with a predominance of the latter (H:G:S molar ratio of 1.5:1:4.9), were also released after Py-GC/MS of abaca fibers. Sinapyl and coniferyl acetates, which are thought to be lignin monomer precursors, were also found in abaca. The extractives content of the abaca fiber (0.4\%) was low, and the most predominant compounds were free sterols (24\% of total extract) and fatty acids (24\% of total extract). Additionally, significant amounts of steroid ketones (10\%), triglycerides (6\%), omega-hydroxyfatty acids (6\%), monoglycerides (4\%), fatty alcohols (4\%), and a series of p-hydroxycinnamyl (p-coumaric and ferulic acids) esterified with long chain alcohols and omega-hydroxyfatty acids were also found, together with minor amounts of steroid hydrocarbons, diglycerides, alpha-hydroxyfatty acids, sterol esters, and sterol glycosides.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key factor in ecosystem dynamics. A better understanding of the global relationship between environmental characteristics, ecosystems and SOM chemistry is vital in order to assess its specific influence on carbon cycles. This study compared the composition of extracted SOM in 18 topsoil samples taken under tundra, taiga, steppe, temperate forest and tropical forest using pyrolysis-GC/MS. Results indicate that SOM from cold climates (tundra, taiga) still resembles the composition of litter, evidenced by high quantities of levosugars and long alkanes relative to N-compounds and a clear odd-over-even dominance of the longer alkanes. Under temperate conditions, increased microbial degradation generally results in a more altered SOM chemistry. SOM formed under temperate coniferous forests shows an accumulation of aromatic and aliphatic moieties, probably induced by substrate limitations. Tropical SOM was characterized by an SOM composition rich in N-compounds and low in lignins, without any accumulation of recalcitrant fractions (i.e. aliphatic and aromatic compounds). Lignin composition moreover varies according to vegetation type. Results were validated against 13 new samples. The humic signature of topsoil organic matter formed under different biomes indicates a dominating effect of (i) SOM input composition related to vegetation, and (ii) SOM breakdown reflecting both climate and input quality. No evidence was found for a chemically stabilized SOM fraction under favorable decomposition conditions (temperate or warm climate with broadleaved vegetation). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To investigate both the effect of land-use systems on SOM characteristics and the effect of occlusion in aggregates on chemical composition of the occluded fraction, SOM fractions of soils under Cerrado, no-tillage and conventional tillage, were investigated. Free light, occluded light and extractable organic matter from native Cerrado and from tilled and untilled fields under maize and bean rotation were separated and chemically analysed by pyrolysis-GC/MS. Ploughing incorporated more fresh OM into the soil than natural biological activity. Degradation of the occluded light fraction was not fully halted, but was different from that of SOM in the extractable fraction. Recalcitrant compounds had low abundances in the free light and extracted fractions, but were more abundant in the occluded light fraction, where the more accessible compounds were depleted by microbial decomposition. Because of intense decomposition, the extracted fractions did not differentiate between land uses, but differences in the light fractions were significant. The results indicate that the decay of the occluded fraction is different from that of the free light fraction: non-ideal circumstances of decay caused a relative accumulation of potentially recalcitrant compounds. When considering the rapid turnover of all components in the soil extracts, disruption of aggregates will probably cause rapid decay of the occluded fraction. The distribution of pyrolysis products that can be ascribed to charred wood (polyaromatics) indicates that this fraction is readily decayed if not occluded. Selective decomposition in the occluded fraction may cause a shift in delta 13C that should not be misinterpreted.},

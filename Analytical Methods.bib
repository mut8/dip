abstract = {A new LC-MS/MS method for the separation and detection of the most prominent marine lipophilic toxin groups comprising okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, yessotoxins, azaspiracids, pectenotoxins, spirolides and some okadaic acid fatty acid esters has been developed. With this method 28 different marine lipophilic biotoxins can be analysed in a single run. Separation was achieved with an acetonitrile/water gradient containing ammonium hydroxide (pH 11). All toxins were stable under these basic conditions. Compared to chromatography using an acidic gradient, the limit of detection (LODs) for okadaic acid, yessotoxin, gymnodimine and 13-desmethyl spirolide C were improved two- to three-fold, mainly due to better peak shapes. The azaspiracids and pectenotoxins-2 showed comparable LODs under acidic and basic conditions. A major advantage of the developed method is that toxins can be clustered in retention time windows separated for positively and negatively ionized molecular ions. Therefore, there is no need for rapid polarity switching or two separate runs for one sample. The new method showed good repeatability and reproducibility and is an important step in the development of alternatives to the animal tests currently in use for shellfish toxin analysis.},

abstract = {The present article reviews the available literature on the analytical and environmental aspects of tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A), a currently intensively used brominated flame retardant (BFR). Analytical methods, including sample preparation, chromatographic separation, detection techniques, and quality control are discussed. An important recent development in the analysis of TBBP-A is the growing tendency for liquid chromatographic techniques. At the detection stage, mass-spectrometry is a well-established and reliable technology in the identification and quantification of TBBP-A. Although interlaboratory exercises for BFRs have grown in popularity in the last 10 years, only a few participating laboratories report concentrations for TBBP-A. Environmental levels of TBBP-A in abiotic and biotic matrices are low, probably due to the major use of TBBP-A as reactive FR. As a consequence, the expected human exposure is low. This is in agreement with the EU risk assessment that concluded that there is no risk for humans concerning TBBP-A exposure. Much less analytical and environmental information exists for the various groups of TBBP-A derivatives which are largely used as additive flame retardants.},

abstract = {During wastewater treatment, many organic micropollutants undergo microbially mediated reactions resulting in the formation of transformation products (TPs). Little is known on the reaction pathways that govern these transformations or on the occurrence of microbial TPs in surface waters. Large sets of biotransformation data for organic micropollutants would be useful for assessing the exposure potential of these TPs and for enabling the development of structure-based biotransformation prediction tools. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient procedure to allow for high-throughput elucidation of TP structures for a broad and diverse set of xenobiotics undergoing microbially mediated transformation reactions. Six pharmaceuticals and six pesticides were spiked individually into batch reactors seeded with activated sludge. Samples from the reactors were separated with HPLC and analyzed by linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Candidate TPs were preliminarily identified with an innovative post-acquisition data processing method based on target and non-target screenings of the full-scan MS data. Structures were proposed following interpretation of MS spectra and MS/MS fragments. Previously unreported microbial TPs were identified for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate, diazepam, levetiracetam, oseltamivir, and valsartan. A variety of previously reported and unreported TPs were identified for the pesticides. The results showed that the complementary use of the target and non-target screening methods allowed for a more comprehensive interpretation of the TPs generated than either would have provided individually.},

abstract = {The quantification of differences between two or more physiological states of a biological system is among the most important but also most challenging technical tasks in proteomics. In addition to the classical methods of differential protein gel or blot staining by dyes and fluorophores, mass-spectrometry-based quantification methods have gained increasing popularity over the past five years. Most of these methods employ differential stable isotope labeling to create a specific mass tag that can be recognized by a mass spectrometer and at the same time provide the basis for quantification. These mass tags can be introduced into proteins or peptides (i) metabolically, (ii) by chemical means, (iii) enzymatically, or (iv) provided by spiked synthetic peptide standards. In contrast, label-free quantification approaches aim to correlate the mass spectrometric signal of intact proteolytic peptides or the number of peptide sequencing events with the relative or absolute protein quantity directly. In this review, we critically examine the more commonly used quantitative mass spectrometry methods for their individual merits and discuss challenges in arriving at meaningful interpretations of quantitative proteomic data.},

abstract = {Perchlorate can competitively inhibit iodide uptake by the thyroid gland (TG) via the sodium/iodide symporter, consequently reducing the production of thyroid hormones (THs). Until recently, the effects of perchlorate on TH homeostasis are being examined through measurement of serum levels of TH, by immunoassay (IA)-based methods. IA methods are fast, but for TH analysis, they are compromised by the lack of adequate specificity. Therefore, selective and sensitive methods for the analysis of THs in TG are needed, for assessment of the effects of perchlorate on TH homeostasis. In this study, we developed a method for the analysis of six THs: L-thyroxine (T(4)), 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T(3)), 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine (rT(3)), 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (3,5-T(2)), 3,3'-diiodo-L-thyronine (3,3'-T(2)), and 3-iodo-L-thyronine (3-T(1)) in TG, using liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). TGs used in this study were from rats that had been placed on either iodide-deficient diet or iodide-sufficient diet, and that had either been provided with perchlorate in drinking water (10 mg/kg/day) or control water. TGs were extracted by pronase digestion and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The instrumental calibration range for each TH ranged from 1 to 200 ng/ml and showed a high linearity (r>0.99). The method quantification limits (LOQs) were determined to be 0.25 ng/mg TG for 3-T(1); 0.33 ng/mg TG for 3,3'- and 3,5-T(2); and 0.52 ng/mg TG for rT(3), T(3), and T(4). Rats were placed on an iodide-deficient or -sufficient diet for 2.5 months, and for the last 2 weeks of that period were provided either perchlorate (10 mg/kg/day) in drinking water or control water. Iodide deficiency and perchlorate administration both reduced TG stores of rT(3), T(3), and T(4). In iodide-deficient rats, perchlorate exacerbated the reduction in levels of THs in TG. With the advances in analytical methodology, the use of LC-MS/MS for measurement of hormone levels in TG will allow more comprehensive evaluations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.},

abstract = {Measurement of steroid esters in bovine hair samples, using sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), provides a powerful tool for identifying animals treated illicitly with growth promoters. The successful application of such testing requires appropriate sampling of hair from treated animals. This paper describes the results of hair analysis by LC-MS/MS for two animal studies in which animals were treated with estradiol-3-benzoate and nortestosterone decanoate. The results from the first animal study indicate that animals treated with these anabolic steroids may not always be identified from analysis of hair samples; positive test results occur sporadically and only for some of the treated animals. The results from the second animal study identify conditions attaching to positive hair samples, such as, that concentrations of steroid esters in hair are related to distance of sampling from point of injection and to time post-treatment, that concentrations of steroid esters in hair are related to dose given to the animal but that this relationship may vary over time post-treatment, and that steroid esters may be measured in regrowth hair taken some weeks after treatment. Steroid esters are determined along the length of the hair, confirming that accumulation of steroid esters into hair occurs from various sources, including blood, sweat and sebum. The reported research provides some useful insights into the mechanisms governing the persistence of steroid esters in bovine hair following illicit treatment with growth promoters.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is a founding pillar of quantitative biology and a valuable tool for studying metabolism and its regulation. Here we present a workflow for metabolomics in microplate format which affords high-throughput and yet quantitative monitoring of primary metabolism in microorganisms and in particular yeast. First, the most critical step of rapid sampling was adapted to a multiplex format by using fritted 96-well plates for cultivation, which ensure fast sample transfer and permit us to use well-established quenching in cold solvents. Second, extensive optimization of large-volume injection on a GC/TOF instrument provided the sensitivity necessary for robust quantification of 30 primary metabolites in 0.6 mg of yeast biomass. The metabolome profiles of baker's yeast cultivated in fritted well plates or in shake flasks were equivalent. Standard deviations of measured metabolites were between 10\% and 50\% within one plate. As a proof of principle we compared the metabolome of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the single-deletion mutant Delta sdh1, which were clearly distinguishable by a 10-fold increase of the intracellular succinate concentration in the mutant. The described workflow allows the production of large amounts of metabolome samples within a day, is compatible with virtually all liquid extraction protocols, and paves the road to quantitative screens.},

abstract = {The presence of a wide variety of organic pollutants with different physicochemical characteristics has been investigated in wastewater samples from a municipal solid-waste-treatment plant in Castell\'{o}n, Spain. An advanced analytical strategy was applied--combined used of two powerful and complementary techniques, GC and LC, both hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry with triple-quadrupole analyzers. The GC-MS-MS method was based on sample extraction using C(18) SPE cartridges and enabled the determination of approximately 60 compounds from different chemical families, for example PAHs, octyl/nonylphenols, PCBs, organochlorine compounds, insecticides, herbicides, and PBDEs. Most of the compounds selected are included as priority contaminants in the European Union (EU) Water Directive. The UHPLC-MS-MS method, which provided high chromatographic resolution and sensitivity and short analysis time, used sample extraction with Oasis HLB SPE cartridges and enabled the determination of 37 (more polar) pesticides. The methodology developed was applied to the analysis of 41 water samples (20 untreated raw leachates and 21 treated samples) collected between March 2007 and February 2009. Amounts of the contaminants investigated rarely exceeded 0.5 microg L(-1) in the treated (reverse osmosis) water samples analyzed. As expected, in untreated leachates the number of compounds detected and the concentrations found were notably higher than in treated waters. The most commonly detected pollutants were herbicides (simazine, terbuthylazine, terbutryn, terbumeton, terbacil, and diuron), fungicides (thiabendazole and carbendazim), and 4-t-octylphenol. The results obtained proved that use of reverse osmosis for water treatment was efficient and notably reduced the amounts of organic contaminants found in raw leachate samples. In order to investigate the presence of other non-target contaminants, water samples were also analyzed by using GC-TOF MS and LC-QTOF MS. Several organic pollutants that did not form a part of the previous list of target contaminants were identified in the samples, because of the high sensitivity of TOF MS in full-spectrum acquisition mode and the valuable accurate-mass information provided by these instruments. The insecticide diazinon, the fungicide diphenylamide, the UV filter benzophenone, N-butylbenzenesulfonamide (N-BBSA), the insect repellent diethyltoluamide, caffeine, and the pharmaceuticals erythromycin, benzenesulfonanilide, ibuprofen, atenolol, and paracetamol were some of the compounds identified in the water samples analyzed.},

Among the different column combinations tested, the best results were obtained when using either a DB-5 type or an HT-8 column as the first dimension combined with a mid-polar stationary phase (50\% phenyl) as the second dimension. The co-elutions between the target PCBs and PBDEs in the first dimension were satisfactorily resolved once transferred to the second column. Repeatability and intermediate precision were satisfactory in both systems, considering retention times in both dimensions. Nevertheless, peak area/volume precision was better for heart-cut MDGC since software for the data analysis in the case of GCxGC was still under development. The need for multiple injections of the same extract on the heart-cut MDGC system was the main drawback since the analysis time it increased. GCxGC becomes then a valuable alternative able to achieve the same performance in one injection. However, the GCxGC data analysis is still very time-consuming and needs further development. The applicability of both separation techniques was shown using a human breast milk sample with low concentrations of PCBs (0.2-227 pg/g fresh weight) and PBDEs (1.2-41 pg/g fresh weight).},

Under the optimized LC conditions, all of the HFRs eluted from the LC column within 14min, while maintaining good chromatographic separation for the isomers. Introduction of the pre-heated dopant to the APPI source decreased the background noise fivefold, which enhanced sensitivity. An empirical equation was proposed to describe the relation between the ion intensity and dopant flow. The excellent on-column instrument detection limits averaged 4.7pg, which was similar to the sensitivity offered by gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). This method was used to analyze a series of fish samples. Good agreement was found between the results for PBDEs from LC-APPI-MS/MS and GC-HRMS.},

Because of the possible risk of antimony by transfer to plants growing on contaminated sites, it is of importance to analyze antimony and its species in such biota. A method based on high performance liquid chromatographic separation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-ICP-MS) was developed to determine inorganic antimony species such as Sb(III) and Sb(V) as well as possible antimony-organic metabolisation products of the antimony transferred into plant material within one chromatographic run. The separation is performed using anion chromatography on a strong anion exchange column (IonPac AS15/AG 15). Based on isocratic optimizations for the separation of Sb(III) and Sb(V) as well as Sb(V) and trimenthylated Sb(V) (TMSb(V)), a chromatographic method with an eluent gradient was developed. The suggested analytical method was applied to aqueous extracts of Chinese break fern Pteris vittata samples. The transfer of antimony from spiked soil composites into the fern, which is known as a hyperaccumulator for arsenic, was investigated under greenhouse conditions. Remarkable amounts of antimony were transferred into roots and leaves of P. vittata growing on spiked soil composites. Generally, P. vittata accumulates not only arsenic (as shown in a multiplicity of studies in the last decade), but also antimony to a lower extent. The main contaminant in the extracts was Sb(V), but also elevated concentrations of Sb(III) and TMSb(V) (all in microg L(-1) range). An unidentified Sb compound in the plant extracts was detected, which slightly differ in elution time from TMSb(V).},

abstract = {We report a new quantitative metabolome profiling technique based on differential (12)C-/(13)C-isotope dansylation labeling of metabolites, fast liquid chromatography (LC) separation and electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR MS) detection. An isotope reagent, (13)C-dansyl chloride, can be readily synthesized. This reagent, along with (12)C-dansyl chloride, provides a simple and robust means of labeling metabolites containing primary amine, secondary amine, or phenolic hydroxyl group(s). It is shown that dansylation labeling offers 1-3 orders of magnitude ESI signal enhancement over the underivatized counterparts. Dansylation alters the chromatographic behaviors of polar and ionic metabolites normally not retainable on a reversed phase (RP) column to an extent that they can be retained and separated by RPLC with high efficiency. There is no isotopic effect on RPLC separation of the differential isotope labeled metabolites, and (12)C-/(13)C-labeled isoforms of metabolites are coeluted and detected by MS for precise and accurate quantification and confident metabolite identification. It is demonstrated that, in the analysis of 20 amino acids, a linear response of over 2 orders of magnitude is achieved for relative metabolite quantification with an average relative standard deviation (RSD) of about 5.3\% from replicate experiments. A dansylation standard compound library consisting of 121 known amines and phenols has been constructed and is proven to be useful for absolute metabolite quantification and MS-based metabolite identification in biological samples. As an example, the absolute concentrations of 93 metabolites, ranging from 30 nM to 2510 microM, can be determined from a pooled sample of human urines collected in 5 consecutive days labeled with (12)C-dansylation and spiked with the 121 (13)C-dansylated standards. Relative concentration variations of these metabolites in individual urine samples can also be monitored by mixing the (13)C-dansylated pooled urine sample with the (12)C-dansylated individual sample. With a 12 min fast LC separation combined with FTICR MS, 672 metabolites were detected in a human urine sample with each metabolite peak having a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 20; the identities of most of the metabolites remain to be determined. This work illustrates that dansylation labeling and fast LC/FTICR MS can be a powerful technique for quantitative profiling of at least 672 metabolites in urine samples in 12 min.},

The method employs solid-phase dispersion on diatomaceous earth in a solid-phase extraction cartridge followed by automated addition of internal standards ((13)C-labeled). Extraction is then performed using an automated modular solid-phase extraction system. The extraction procedure includes drying the sample on diatomaceous earth by pressurized nitrogen and eluting target analytes and lipids with dichloromethane. Lipid content is determined gravimetrically. Lipid determinations performed using this method are compared with other standard methods and with a certified reference material. A relative standard deviation of 7.9\% was obtained for 130 determinations of the lipid content in a breast milk quality control sample. Final analytical determination of target analytes was performed by gas chromatography-isotope dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry. Relative standard deviations for the measurements of target analytes for which a labeled internal standard was available were below 10\% for analytes at concentrations above 1 ng/g of lipid. Mean recoveries of the (13)C-labeled internal standards ranged from 60 to 89\% for the eight PBDE congeners; 74 and 113\% were recovered for BB-153 and CB-153, respectively.},

They are often followed by more detailed statistical analysis or additional 2D NMR analysis for biomarker discovery. The standard acquisition time per sample is 4-5 min for a simple 1D spectrum, and both preparation and analysis can be automated to allow application to high-throughput screening for clinical diagnostic and toxicological studies, as well as molecular phenotyping and functional genomics.},

Mass spectral and chemometric deconvolution procedures were used to resolve overlapping peaks. On the highly efficient column, 195 PCB congeners were resolved in 96 min separation time using spectral and chemometric deconvolution. This number is comparable to the best separations described in GC x GC-MS mode.

Among a number of extraction and clean-up methods tested, pressurized liquid extraction followed by gel permeation chromatography and florisil clean-up proved to be simple, robust and optimized so that all target analytes (parent compounds and metabolites) were collected in a single fraction. Extracts were analyzed by GC-HRMS to identify PBDEs. Following, the same extracts were derivatized and re-analyzed by GC-HRMS to determine 11 target and 35 non-target OH- and MeO-PBDEs. Monitoring of the M(+) for MeO-PBDEs and the [M-CH(2)CO](+) ions for derivatized OH-PBDEs at 10,000 resolution permitted unequivocal identification of the PBDE metabolites in the environmental matrices examined. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, detection limits and long-term stability. The analytical precision obtained with this method was between 0.3 and 17\%, and the limits of quantification were lower than 3.28 pg/g dry weight, 20.5 and 41.4 pg/g lipid weight in sediment, milk and fish, respectively.

The analytes were extracted using a sorbent of polystyrene-divinylbenzene and an additional clean-up was performed on a sulphuric acid-silica column to remove lipids. The method has been validated by spiking horse serum at five levels. The mean accuracy given as recovery relative to internal standards was 95\%, 99\%, 93\% and 109\% for the PBDEs PCBs, OCs and brominated phenols, respectively. The mean repeatability given as RSDs was respectively 6.9\%, 8.7\%, 7.5\% and 15\%. Estimated limits of detection (S/N=3) were in the range 0.2-1.8 pg/g serum for the PBDEs and phenols, and from 0.1 pg/g to 56 pg/g serum for the PCBs and OCs. The validated method has been used to investigate the levels of PBDEs and PCBs in 21 pooled serum samples from the general Norwegian population. In serum from men (age 40-50 years) the sum of seven PBDE congeners (IUPAC No. 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183) increased from 1977 (0.5 ng/g lipids) to 1998 (4.8 ng/g lipids). From 1999 to 2003 the concentration of PBDEs seems to have stabilised. On the other hand, the sum of five PCBs (IUPAC No. 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) in these samples decreased steadily from 1977 (666 ng/g lipids) to 2003 (176 ng/g lipids). Tetrabromobisphenol-A and BDE-209 were detected in almost all samples, but no similar temporal trends to that seen for the PBDEs were observed for these compounds, which might be due to the short half-lives of these brominated flame retardants (FR) in humans.},

abstract = {A method has been developed for the target analysis of over 100 pesticides and contaminants in a complex feed matrix. The method is based on extraction with ethyl acetate, cleanup by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and dispersive solid-phase extraction (SPE) with primary secondary amine phase (PSA), and analysis by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with full scan time-of-flight mass spectrometric detection (GC x GC-TOF-MS). Parameters studied during method development included a dispersive SPE cleanup step after GPC, large volume injection into the GC system and the GC x GC separation. Qualitative and quantitative performance of the GC x GC system was evaluated by analyzing spiked extracts in the range equivalent to 1-100 microg/kg in feed. At levels of 50 microg/kg and higher, all compounds targeted for could be identified fully automatically by the software based on their mass spectra. At lower levels the hit rate decreased with the concentration. System linearity was excellent in solvent and only slightly affected by matrix (correlation coefficients r>or=0.995 for 90\% of the compounds). Limits of quantification were in the 1-20 microg/kg range for most compounds. The overall method was validated for 106 compounds at the 10 and 100 microg/kg level. Recoveries between 70\% and 110\% and RSDs below 20\% were obtained for the majority of the compounds.},

abstract = {A sensitive and selective method utilizing high performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (APCI-LC/MS/MS) was developed to enable analysis of selected natural persistent organohalogens accumulated in marine biota. The analytes were three methoxylated tetrabromodiphenyl ethers (6-MeO-BDE47, 2'-MeO-BDE68, and 2',6-diMeO-BDE68), a dimethoxylated tetrabromobiphenyl (2,2'-diMeO-BB80), and two halogenated methyl bipyrroles (Cl(7)-MBP and Br(4)Cl(2)-DBP). These products were well resolved on a 150 mm reversed-phase column with methanol as the mobile phase. The fragmentation pathways of the Cl(7)-MBP and Br(4)Cl(2)-DBP produced characteristic multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions. Determination was performed in the MRM mode using phenoxide ion [M-Br+O](-) and product Br(-) ions for MeO-BDE analogues, or the precursor [M-Cl+O](-) to Br(-) ion for Br(4)Cl(2)-DBP, and to C(4)NCl(4)(-) ion for Cl(7)-MBP. The APCI-LC/MS/MS method is acceptable for calibration of the linearity and repeatability of all products studied in the low ng/g (lipid weight) level and with similar sensitivity to the electron ionization (EI)-GC/MS method. The proposed method was applied for quantification of natural organohalogens accumulated in melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra) blubber (N = 15) in the Asia-Pacific Ocean. The concentration was positively correlated between different groups of compounds except for 2'-MeO-BDE68. The use of the analytical method based on negative ion APCI-LC/MS/MS would provide a new way for rapid monitoring of halogenated natural products from marine biota, such as sponges or algae.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies use blood obtained noninvasively to monitor organohalogen contaminants; however, blood can be difficult to analyze because of its aqueous nature and high protein content. We compared five methods for extracting polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organochlorine pesticides, and lipids from serum using National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material 1589a PCBs, Pesticides, PBDEs, and Dioxins/Furans in Human Serum. Liquid:liquid (LLE), cavity-dispersed microwave-assisted (MAE), focused microwave-assisted (FME), solid-phase (SPE), and pressurized fluid (PFE) extraction techniques were compared. FME extraction yielded the optimal recovery of internal standards (IS). All methods resulted in similar contaminant concentrations that also agreed with the certified values for SRM 1589a, except for only a few compounds measured by methods other than FME. Based on these findings, the FME method was determined to be the best overall extraction method. One procedural factor was found to affect contaminant concentrations; use of IS carrier solvents that were immiscible with serum (or when the serum was not directly physically mixed with IS) resulted in a 30\% underestimation of organohalogen concentrations. This study offers valid, novel extraction alternatives beyond traditional methods (e.g., LLE) for blood contaminant measurements.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous chemicals may interfere with the thyroid system that is essential in the development and physiology of vertebrates. We applied a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor-based screening method for the fast screening of chemicals with thyroxine (T4) transport disrupting activity. Two inhibition assays using the main thyroid hormone transport proteins, T4 binding globulin (TBG) and transthyretin (TTR), in combination with a T4-coated biosensor chip were optimized and automated for screening chemical libraries. The transport protein-based biosensor assays were rapid, high throughput and bioeffect-related. A library of 62 chemicals including the natural hormones, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and metabolites, halogenated bisphenol A (BPA), halogenated phenols, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and other potential environmentally relevant chemicals was tested with the two assays. We discovered ten new active compounds with moderate to high affinity for TBG with the TBG assay. Strikingly, the most potent binding was observed with hydroxylated metabolites of the brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) BDE 47, BDE 49 and BDE 99, that are commonly found in human plasma. The TTR assay confirmed the activity of previously identified hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs and PBDEs, halogenated BPA and genistein. These results show that the hydroxylated metabolites of the ubiquitous PBDEs not only target the T4 transport at the TTR level, but also, and to a great extent, at the TBG level where most of the T4 in humans is circulating. The optimized SPR biosensor-based transport protein assay is a suitable method for high throughput screening of large libraries for potential thyroid hormone disrupting compounds.},

@article{Hernandez2009,
abstract = {The potential of gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) for screening anthropogenic organic contaminants in human breast adipose tissues has been investigated. Initially a target screening was performed for a list of 125 compounds which included persistent halogen pollutants [organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenylss (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)], polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylphenols, and a notable number of pesticides from the different fungicide, herbicide and insecticide families. Searching for target pollutants was done by evaluating the presence of up to five representative ions for every analyte, all measured at accurate mass (20-mDa mass window). The experimental ion abundance ratios were then compared to those of reference standards for confirmation. Sample treatment consisted of an extraction with hexane and subsequent normal-phase (NP) High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or SPE cleanup. The fat-free LC fractions were then investigated by GC-TOF MS.Full-spectral acquisition and accurate mass data generated by GC-TOF MS also allowed the investigation of nontarget compounds using appropriate processing software to manage MS data. Identification was initially based on library fit using commercial nominal mass libraries. This was followed by comparing the experimental accurate masses of the most relevant ions with the theoretical exact masses with calculations made using the elemental composition calculator included in the software.The application of both target and nontarget approaches to around 40 real samples allowed the detection and confirmation of several target pollutants including p,p'-DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Several nontarget compounds that could be considered anthropogenic pollutants were also detected. These included 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-toluene (BHT) and its metabolite 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (BHT-CHO), dibenzylamine, N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (N-BBSA), some naphthalene-related compounds and several PCBs isomers not included in the target list. As some of the compounds detected are xenoestrogens, the methodology developed in this paper could be useful in human breast cancer research.},

abstract = {The orthogonality of three columns coupled in two series was studied for the congener specific comprehensive two-dimensional GC separation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). A non-polar capillary column coated with poly(5\%-phenyl-95\%-methyl)siloxane was used as the first ((1)D) column in both series. A polar capillary column coated with 70\% cyanopropyl-polysilphenylene-siloxane or a capillary column coated with the ionic liquid 1,12-di(tripropylphosphonium)dodecane bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide were used as the second ((2)D) columns. Nine multi-congener standard PCB solutions containing subsets of all native 209 PCBs, a mixture of 209 PCBs as well as Aroclor 1242 and 1260 formulations were used to study the orthogonality of both column series. Retention times of the corresponding PCB congeners on (1)D and (2)D columns were used to construct retention time dependences (apex plots) for assessing orthogonality of both columns coupled in series. For a visual assessment of the peak density of PCBs congeners on a retention plane, 2D images were compared. The degree of orthogonality of both column series was, along the visual assessment of distribution of PCBs on the retention plane, evaluated also by Pearson's correlation coefficient, which was found by correlation of retention times t(R,i,2D) and t(R,i,1D) of corresponding PCB congeners on both column series. It was demonstrated that the apolar+ionic liquid column series is almost orthogonal both for the 2D separation of PCBs present in Aroclor 1242 and 1260 formulations as well as for the separation of all of 209 PCBs. All toxic, dioxin-like PCBs, with the exception of PCB 118 that overlaps with PCB 106, were resolved by the apolar/ionic liquid series while on the apolar/polar column series three toxic PCBs overlapped (105+127, 81+148 and 118+106).},

abstract = {The potential of ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) for the screening and confirmation of antibiotics in water samples is illustrated in this paper. UHPLC presents several advantages over conventional liquid chromatography as it generates narrow peaks (increasing peak height and improving sensitivity) and reduces chromatographic runs. Regarding QTOF-MS, its increased mass resolution, high sensitivity in full-spectrum acquisition mode and mass accuracy, in both MS and MS/MS modes, make this technique ideal for the detection and reliable confirmation of organic contaminants in environmental samples. After a solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges, UHPLC-QTOF-MS has been applied in this work to several types of water samples (surface water and influent and effluent wastewaters). Several antibiotics were found in the samples, such as ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarythromycin or erythromycin, among others. Moreover, the full spectrum data provided by TOF-MS acquisition has enabled searching for many other pharmaceuticals that could be present in the samples in a "post-target" way. This approach has allowed the detection and confirmation of paracetamol, omeprazole and codeine, among others. UPLC-QTOF-MS has been shown as an attractive and efficient hyphenated technique for the rapid detection and confirmation of pharmaceuticals in water with very little sample handling.},

Hydroxylated metabolites were extracted using liquid-to-liquid extraction, resolved on a C18 column with gradient elution and detected by mass spectrometry in single ion recording mode using electrospray negative ionization. The assay was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of quantification, range and recovery. Calibration curves were linear (R2 > or = 0.98) over a concentration range of 0.010-1.0 microM for 4-OH-2,2',3,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (4-OH-BDE-90), 5'-OH-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (5'-OH-BDE-99) and 6'-OH-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (6'-OH-BDE-99), and a concentration range of 0.0625-12.5 microM for 2,4,5-tribromophenol (2,4,5-TBP). Inter- and intra-day accuracy values ranged from -2.0\% to 6.0\% and from -7.7\% to 7.3\%, respectively, and inter- and intra-day precision values ranged from 2.0\% to 8.5\% and from 2.2\% to 8.6\% (n=6), respectively. The limits of quantification were 0.010 microM for 4-OH-BDE-90, 5'-OH-BDE-99 and 6'-OH-BDE-99, and 0.0625 microM for 2,4,5-TBP. Recovery values ranged between 85 and 100\% for the four analytes. The validated analytical method was applied to identify and quantify hydroxy BDE-99 metabolites formed in vitro. Incubation of BDE-99 with rat liver microsomes yielded 4-OH-BDE-90 and 6'-OH-BDE-99 as major metabolites and 5'-OH-BDE-99 and 2,4,5-TBP as minor metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first validated UPLC/MS method to quantify hydroxylated metabolites of PBDEs without the need of derivatization.},

abstract = {The impact of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) on the environment and their potential risk in animal and human health is a present concern. Therefore, existing legislation in the European Union demands that polymers with BFRs are identified and eliminated from the recycling process due to their potential health hazard. In this work, a flow-injection (FI) system coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was optimized for the detection of traces of bromine in polymers, plastic paints and enamels containing BFRs. Sample preparation requires a microwave-assisted digestion in order to transfer bromine in polymeric samples to solution. After appropriate optimization of the digestion procedure and the ICP-MS detection, a detection limit (DL) of 4.2 mg kg(-1) was obtained for synthesized polyurethane standards containing known concentrations of bromine. The precision of the proposed method, evaluated as the R.S.D. of signals obtained for three replicates of polymeric standard BFRs at the normative EU level, was as low as 3.6\%. This simple developed methodology was characterized for the screening of bromine in polymeric matrices. The proposed system provides rapid binary yes/no overall responses, being appropriate for the screening of bromine above a pre-set concentration threshold. The unreliability region (UR), given by the probability of false positives and false negatives (set at 5\% in both cases), was in the range between 442 and 678 mg kg(-1) of bromine (at a cut-off level of 0.1\% in BFRs by weight of homogeneous material fixed by the EU normative). Finally, the applicability of the proposed screening system was tested for the reliable control of bromine in different commercial samples including flame-retardant paints and enamels.},

The optimal setup for our purpose was further validated against a set of serum samples from 30 healthy individuals. We also assessed the reproducibility of chromatographic columns with the same chemistry of stationary phase from the same manufacturer but from different production batches. The results have allowed the authors to prepare SOPs for "fit for purpose" long-term UPLC-MS metabolomic studies, such as are being employed in the HUSERMET project.

abstract = {A step by step strategy of optimization of comprehensive off-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) separations is proposed. The goal of an optimization process in the separation sciences is either to achieve a given resolution (a target peak capacity in 2D-LC) within as short a time as possible or to reach the highest possible resolution in a given analysis time. The proposed method takes into account the characteristics of the columns used in the first and the second dimension and the number of fractions of the first dimension eluent that should be collected. The effect of the time spent during the analysis on the second dimension column to carry out necessary tasks that are not the separation itself (called the additional time) on the maximum peak capacity that is achievable was carefully investigated. It was shown that (1) an increase in the peak capacity of the first dimension column combined with the collection of larger volume fractions permits a significant reduction of the time needed to achieve the desired peak capacity; and (2) there is an optimum fraction collection ratio (or number of collected fractions per peak) which yields the target peak capacity in the minimum time. The proposed strategy was used for the optimization of the separation of samples of BSA tryptic digest by an off-line 2D-LC using an SCXmultiply sign in circleRP-HPLC method. As a result of this optimization, a peak capacity of 4000 could be achieved in about 5h with the two columns available. The time needed for the optimized analysis was less than two thirds of the analysis time that would have been needed had the conventional rule of thumb of sample collection in comprehensive on-line 2D-LC (4 samples/peak) been followed.},

abstract = {One of the major obstacles in metabolomics is the identification of unknown metabolites. We tested constraints for reidentifying the correct structures of 29 known metabolite peaks from GCT premier accurate mass chemical ionization GC-TOF mass spectrometry data without any use of mass spectral libraries. Correct elemental formulas were retrieved within the top-3 hits for most molecular ion adducts using the "Seven Golden Rules" algorithm. An average of 514 potential structures per formula was downloaded from the PubChem chemical database and in-silico-derivatized using the ChemAxon software package. After chemical curation, Kovats retention indices (RI) were predicted for up to 747 potential structures per formula using the NIST MS group contribution algorithm and corrected for contribution of trimethylsilyl groups using the Fiehnlib RI library. When matching the range of predicted RI values against the experimentally determined peak retention, all but three incorrect formulas were excluded. For all remaining isomeric structures, accurate mass electron ionization spectra were predicted using the MassFrontier software and scored against experimental spectra. Using a mass error window of 10 ppm for fragment ions, 89\% of all isomeric structures were removed and the correct structure was reported in 73\% within the top-5 hits of the cases.},

A mobile phase methanol/acetone/water was used, where acetone acts also as dopant. NI-APPI produced precursor ions corresponding to [M-H](-) for TBBP-A, [M-Br+O](-), and [M-2Br+O](-) for the BDE congeners studied. Each compound was quantified operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Linearity was observed in the range 0.025-10 ng injected for all compounds. Coefficients of determination R(2) ranged from 0.9934 to 0.9982. BDEs were poorly retained by solid-phase extraction (SPE) from river water and sewage treatment plant effluent, thus liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) by n-hexane should be used for these samples. The recoveries of TBBP-A and PBDEs from tap water (SPE), river water and industrial wastewater (LLE) were in the range of 81-88\%, 78-92\%, and 43-99\%, respectively, with relative standard deviations below 17\%. The limits of detection, based on signal-to-noise ratio of 3, ranged from 0.004 to 0.1 ng injected, and method quantification limits were 0.2-3.3 ng L(-1) but BDE47 (20.3 ng L(-1)). Only TBBP-A was found in a treated industrial sewage at 4 ng L(-1), while BDE-99 and BDE-100 were detected on suspended solids.},

abstract = {A convenient analytical method for the simultaneous determination of more than 40 pharmaceuticals belonging to various therapeutic categories in whole blood has been developed. Exemplarily, the method was fully validated for eight different pharmaceuticals. The procedure entails addition of acetonitrile, magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride to a small amount of blood, then the mixture is shaken intensively and centrifuged for phase separation. An aliquot of the organic layer is cleaned up by dispersive solid-phase extraction employing bulk sorbents as well as magnesium sulfate for the removal of residual water. This method was based on the QuEChERS approach developed for pesticide residue analysis in food. Gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with electron (EI) and chemical (CI) ionisation was then used for qualitative and quantitative determination of the pharmaceuticals. The dispersive SPE with PSA (sorbent functionalized with primary and secondary amines) was found more suitable than aminopropyl and a styrene-divinylbenzene sorbent for sample clean-up before drug level determination in whole blood and plasma, as it was found that most of endogenous matrix components were removed and the analytes were isolated from spiked samples with recoveries above 80\%. Variation coefficients of the repeatability typically smaller than 10\% have been achieved for a wide range of the investigated substances. The used analytical conditions allowed to separate successively a variety of drugs and poisons with the typical limit of detection at <20 ng mL(-1) levels using 1 microL injection of equivalent blood sample in whole blood. The method is simple, rapid, cheap and very effective for therapeutic drug monitoring and forensic chemistry.},

The analytes were analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS/MS, in positive and negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, acquiring two diagnostic product ions from each of the chosen precursor ions for the unambiguous confirmation of the hormones. The method was validated at the validation level of 0.5ng/g. The accuracy and precision of the method were satisfactory. The decision limits CCalpha ranged from 0.03 to 0.14ng/g while the detection capabilities CCbeta ranged from 0.05 to 0.24ng/g. The developed method is sensitive and useful for detection, quantification and confirmation of these anabolic steroids in muscle tissue and can be used for residue control programs.},

abstract = {The single ratio kinetic method is applied to the discrimination and quantification of the thyroid hormone isomers, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine and 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine, in the gas phase, based on the kinetics of the competitive unimolecular dissociations of singly charged transition-metal ion-bound trimeric complexes [M(II)(A)(ref*)(2)-H](+) (M(II) = divalent transition-metal ion; A = T(3) or rT(3); ref* = reference ligand). The trimeric complex ions are generated using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and the ions undergo collisional activation to realize isomeric discrimination from the branching ratio of the two fragment pathways that form the dimeric complexes [M(II)(A)(ref*)-H](+) and [M(II)(ref*)(2)-H](+). The ratio of the individual branching ratios for the two isomers R(iso) is found strongly dependent on the references and the metal ions. Various sets are tried by choosing the reference from amino acids, substituted amino acids, and dipeptides in combination with the central metal ion chosen from five transition-metal ions (Co(II), Cu(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)) for the complexes in this experiment. The results are compared in terms of the isomeric discrimination for the T(3)/rT(3) pair. Calibration curves are constructed by relating the ratio of the branching ratios against the isomeric composition of their mixture to allow rapid quantitative isomer analysis of the sample pair. Furthermore, the instrument-dependence of this method is investigated by comparing the two sets of results, one obtained from a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer and the other from a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer.},

The bundle of synthetic fibers coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was packed into the head section of the needle, and served as the extraction medium. Using the post-column dilution of the LC eluent by water and subsequent extraction with the needle interface, the analyte was successfully concentrated to the PDMS phase on the fibrous support in the needle. The concentrated analytes were directly injected to GC system by inserting the needle to a heated GC injector. 2D separations of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, and also kerosene-extract were performed with the off-line RPLC-GC system interfaced by the needle extractor. The results suggested that the fiber-packed needle interface could be one of the simple and effective approaches to develop an on-line coupled LC-GC system.},

abstract = {Thermal extraction-GC-MS (TE-GC-MS) is a relatively new analytical technique which demonstrates a large potential for the analysis of various solid matrices. This technique provides a rapid quantitative and simultaneous determination of a wide range of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds without laborious sample preparation or any chemical pre-treatment. Its amenability to automation and coupling with on-line detection methods makes TE-GC-MS a promising technique, not only in laboratory analysis, but also for in situ emission monitoring. However, the number of studies dedicated to the application of TE-GC-MS to fly ashes, which are an unavoidable by-product of any thermal industrial process and also the sink of many environmental pollutants, is limited. The ability of TE-GC-MS to analyse a wide range of trace semi-volatile dioxin surrogate compounds in fly ash samples is investigated as an alternative to the well-established solvent extraction-GC-MS analysis (SE-GC-MS). Reproducibility, the effect of TE temperature, time, flow, and the influence of the analysed matrix are studied. Dedicated experiments demonstrate that the conversion (dechlorination and in situ formation) of target analytes and the decomposition of the fly ash matrix can take place at elevated TE temperatures and during prolonged TE times. Moreover, these effects are matrix-specific and vary from sample to sample. After optimizing the TE parameters, two fly ash samples of different origins are analysed and more than 50 individual analytes representing different classes of aromatic compounds are quantified and compared with those available from the SE-GC-MS analysis.},

abstract = {Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor mediating the adverse effects of dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, we investigated the genetic-, time-, dose-, species- and tissue-dependent AhR-mediated agonistic/antagonistic activities of three food flavonoids: quercetin, chrysin and genistein. To that end, four stably transfected cell lines were used in cell-based luciferase reporter gene assays: three lines were transformed with the ptKLuc vector harbouring four dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and the luciferase gene (HepG2-Luc, T-47D-Luc and H4IIE-ULg). The fourth is a patented cell line transformed with a different construct: H4IIE DR-CALUX((R)). Both H4IIE cells were compared for their genetic construction. Human hepatoma (HepG2-Luc) and human breast tumour (T-47D-Luc) cells were compared for tissue-dependent effects. Rat hepatoma (H4IIE-ULg) and human hepatoma (HepG2-Luc) cells were compared for species-dependent activities. We concluded that quercetin, chrysin and genistein act in a time-, dose-, species- and tissue-specific way. For example, genistein displayed agonistic activities when exposed to rat hepatoma cells during 6h but not after 24h. Flavonoids displayed agonistic/antagonistic activities in human breast tumour cells, depending on the exposure time, while in human hepatoma cells, only antagonistic activities of flavonoids were measured. In addition, we report, in all the cells, a synergy between an isoflavone and two food contaminants; the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 3-methylcholanthrene, a PAH. In rat cells, this synergy occurred when cells were exposed to flavonoids and contaminant for 6h, while it was observed in human cells only after 24h.},

abstract = {Multi-dimensional analysis (MDA) in analytical chemistry is often applied to improve the selectivity of an analytical device and, therefore, to achieve a better overview of a sample composition. Recently, the hyphenation of thermogravimetry with single photo ionization mass spectrometry (TG-SPIMS) using an electron beam pumped excimer lamp (EBEL) for VUV radiation was applied. The concept of MDA has been realized by upgrading the TG-SPIMS system with a quasi comprehensive chromatographic separation step before the soft ionization (TG-GCxSPIMS). The system was characterized by the thermal analysis of diesel fuel, which has often been investigated by the GCxGC-community and is therefore a well-known sample material in MDA. Data from this measurement are used to explain the three-dimensional data structure and the advantages of the online TG-GCxSPIMS as compared to TG-SPIMS. Subsequently, the thermal decomposition behavior of a polymer, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), is investigated. TG-GCxSPIMS provides a two-dimensional analysis of the evolved gaseous products. TG relevant data are obtained as well as an improved resolution power to separate isobaric molecular structures without losing any fraction of the samples, as is often the case in heart cutting approaches. Additionally, this solution is not associated with any extension of the measurement time. The assignment of the substance pattern to distinct species is improved as compared to solely using mass spectrometry without a preceding separation step. Furthermore, hitherto undetected compounds have been found in the evolved gases from the thermal degradation of ABS. Finally, a first estimation of the limit of detection has been carried out. This results in a significant decrease of the LOD in case of TG-GCxSPIMS (500 ppt for toluene) as compared to 30 ppb, which could be reached with TG-SPIMS.},

abstract = {An automated direct sample introduction technique coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (DSI-GC x GC/TOF-MS) was applied for the development of a relatively fast and easy analytical screening method for 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and 4 non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish oil. Comparison of instrumental performance between DSI-GC x GC/TOF-MS and the traditional gas chromatographic high resolution mass spectrometric (GC-HRMS) method showed good agreement of results for standard solutions analyzed in blind fashion. Relatively high tolerance of the DSI technique for lipids in the final extracts enabled a streamlined sample preparation procedure that only required gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) cleanup with graphitized carbon black. The sample size for the method was 2g of cod liver oil, which achieved limits of quantitation (LOQs) of 0.019-7.8 pg/g toxic equivalent quotients for the individual PCDD/Fs. Lower detection limits can be achieved by using larger sample size and scaling up the sample preparation procedure, but this adds to the labor, time, solvent consumption, and expense of the approach. However, the streamlined method yielded 0.94 pg/g and 2.3 pg/g LOQs for 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzofuran (TCDF) and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachloro biphenyl (CB126), which were sufficiently low for regulatory monitoring of 2g samples. Therefore, instead of congener specific analysis, this streamlined analytical screening method for TCDF and CB126 has the potential to monitor fish oil contaminated with dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs at or above current food safety limits. Acceptable recoveries for nearly all analytes at three different spiking levels in fish oil samples were achieved with good repeatability.},

The target analytes included phenols (nitrophenols, chlorophenols, bromophenols and alkylphenols), acidic herbicides (phenoxy acids and dicamba) and several pharmaceuticals. Experimental variables affecting derivatisation yield and peak shape as a function of different experimental PTV parameters [initial injection time, pressure and temperature and the ratio solvent volume/N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) volume] were first optimised by an experimental design approach. Subsequently, SBSE conditions, such as pH, ionic strength, agitation speed and extraction time were investigated. After optimisation, the method failed only for the extraction of most polar phenols and some pharmaceuticals, being suitable for the determination of 37 (out of 46) pollutants, with detection limits for these analytes ranging between 1 and 800 ng/L and being lower than 25 ng/L in most cases. Finally, the developed method was validated and applied to the determination of target analytes in various aqueous environmental matrices, including ground, river and wastewater. Acceptable accuracy (70-130\%) and precision values (<20\%) were obtained for most analytes independently of the matrix, with the exception of some alkylphenols, where an isotopically labelled internal standard would be required in order to correct for matrix effects.

abstract = {This protocol describes an analytical platform for the analysis of intra- and extracellular metabolites of microbial cells (yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The protocol is subdivided into sampling, sample preparation, chemical derivatization of metabolites, GC-MS analysis and data processing and analysis. This protocol uses two robust quenching methods for microbial cultures, the first of which, cold glycerol-saline quenching, causes reduced leakage of intracellular metabolites, thus allowing a more reliable separation of intra- and extracellular metabolites with simultaneous stopping of cell metabolism. The second, fast filtration, is specifically designed for quenching filamentous micro-organisms. These sampling techniques are combined with an easy sample-preparation procedure and a fast chemical derivatization reaction using methyl chloroformate. This reaction takes place at room temperature, in aqueous medium, and is less prone to matrix effect compared with other derivatizations. This protocol takes an average of 10 d to complete and enables the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of metabolites from the central carbon metabolism (amino and nonamino organic acids, phosphorylated organic acids and fatty acid intermediates) using an in-house MS library and a data analysis pipeline consisting of two free software programs (Automated Mass Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) and R).},

The results of a systematic study of the optimization and application of capillary electrophoresis (CE) in conjunction with a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) and inductively-coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to the analysis of the seed extract of the Japanese Pagoda Tree (Sophora japonica) are presented. The off-line coupling of CE to the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the proteins mixture was applied. The cathode end of the capillary was placed inside a stainless steel needle using a coaxial liquid-sheath-flow configuration. The optimization of experimental parameters resulted in an efficient methodology for MS analysis of fractions. Several components contained in the extract of S. japonica were identified, some not previously known. It was demonstrated that low sensitivity, which is a real problem in off-line CE-MS analysis, could be tolerated because of a more flexible optimization of the CE separation conditions and the choice of independent stand-alone instruments for analysis of separated fractions. The estimated limit of detection for CE-RP-HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS was 50 microM of polyphenols and for CE-ICP-MS, 1-100 microg/l.},

abstract = {This protocol describes how to use cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase (CYP)-expressing cell lines in toxicity testing of chemicals in vitro. Selected cells amenable to permanently grow in culture are genetically manipulated to stably express single CYP enzymes originating from any species of interest. This expression can be characterized by, for example, determining CYP mRNA content, CYP protein level (western blotting or in situ immunofluorescence) and CYP-mediated enzyme activity (substrate conversion assays). These cells can be used to determine substrate specificities and species differences, e.g., in the bioactivation of drugs. Once constructed, CYP-expressing cells can serve as a straightforward and reliable tool in toxicity testing and the corresponding assays could be adapted for high-throughput analysis. Using these cells, enzyme assays can be performed in a matter of hours. This protocol is exemplified with V79 fibroblasts from Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus), modified to express human cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1). These cells are characterized for their CYP1B1-linked properties by in situ immunofluorescence and their activity in the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase enzyme assay. This is followed by an assay showing metabolic activation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dibenzo[a,l]pyrene by CYP1B1, along with the toxicological endpoints of cytotoxicity and micronucleus formation.},

abstract = {A liquid nitrogen jet-cooled thermal modulator dedicated to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography has been mounted in a GC oven coupled to a high resolution magnetic sector mass spectrometry instrument. The data acquisition parameters of the slow double-focusing magnetic sector MS instrument have been optimized to accommodate the description of the narrow modulated GC peaks. Acquisition rates were increased to 20Hz, while maintaining high mass resolution. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) descriptors, typically including several ions for both native and labeled analytes, were thus reduced to one or two to ensure enough MS cycle time. For maximization of the sensitivity enhancement due to cryogenic zone compression (CZC), the entire GC peak of interest was trapped and remobilized in one event. Optimization of the method resulted in the ability to detect low attogram (ag) amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) (313ag gives a S/N of 400:1), a level that had not yet been attained using classical GC-HRMS. An isotope-dilution calibration curve was constructed using (13)C(12)-2,3,7,8-TCDD as the internal standard over the range of 500ag/$\mu$L to 35,000ag/$\mu$L (R(2)=0.9953). Analyses of a standard natural human reference serum-matrix NIST SRM 1589a containing 223ag of 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD) (70\% recovery rate assumed) resulted in a peak with a S/N of 188:1 (4 sigma, m/z=355.8546). Measurement of 2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl-1,1,1-trichloroethane) (DDE) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) in human dried-blood spot (DBS) samples is also reported to illustrate the usefulness of such a sensitive technique. Finally, some of the challenges related to sample preparation, blank levels, and to the fact of measuring of such a limited number of molecules (less than 600,000 TCDD molecules) are discussed.},

High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of HBCD diastereoisomers. A detailed study was carried out to optimize the composition of the mobile phase involving methanol/acetonitrile/water, and the values of MS/MS parameters. It was found that the mobile phase could simultaneously affect the chromatographic separation and sensitivity. The instrumental limits of detection (LODs) on column in this study were 0.5, 0.3 and 0.3 pg for alpha-HBCD, beta-HBCD and gamma-HBCD, respectively. The effects of extracted matrix components on HBCD determination were investigated by spiking air and soil sample extracts with three 13C-labelled individual stereoisomers. The results indicated that the responses of the HBCD analysis in air and soils were not significantly affected by matrix effects. The method reported here was further applied to the air and soil samples. Three HBCD diastereoisomers were detected in all the air and soil samples, with levels ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 pg/m3 and 1.7 to 5.6 ng/g dry weight, respectively.},

Complete extraction of TBBPA was achieved using a combination of polar/non-polar solvent system (isopropanol/n-hexane) and high extraction temperatures (130 degrees C). Lower extraction yields were, however, obtained for Deca-BDE, due to its high molecular weight and its non-polar nature. The developed method was successfully applied to the screening of BFRs in standard plastic samples from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE); TBBPA could be fully recovered, and Deca-BDE could be identified, together with minor order polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use a quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) method to predict the retention times of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC). We analyse the GC×GC retention data taken from the literature by comparing predictive capability of different regression methods. The various models are generated using 70 out of 209 PCB congeners in the calibration stage, while their predictive performance is evaluated on the remaining 139 compounds. The two-dimensional chromatogram is initially estimated by separately modelling retention times of PCBs in the first and in the second column ((1) t (R) and (2) t (R), respectively). In particular, multilinear regression (MLR) combined with genetic algorithm (GA) variable selection is performed to extract two small subsets of predictors for (1) t (R) and (2) t (R) from a large set of theoretical molecular descriptors provided by the popular software Dragon, which after removal of highly correlated or almost constant variables consists of 237 structure-related quantities. Based on GA-MLR analysis, a four-dimensional and a five-dimensional relationship modelling (1) t (R) and (2) t (R), respectively, are identified. Single-response partial least square (PLS-1) regression is alternatively applied to independently model (1) t (R) and (2) t (R) without the need for preliminary GA variable selection. Further, we explore the possibility of predicting the two-dimensional chromatogram of PCBs in a single calibration procedure by using a two-response PLS (PLS-2) model or a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) with two output neurons. In the first case, regression is carried out on the full set of 237 descriptors, while the variables previously selected by GA-MLR are initially considered as ANN inputs and subjected to a sensitivity analysis to remove the redundant ones. Results show PLS-1 regression exhibits a noticeably better descriptive and predictive performance than the other investigated approaches. The observed values of determination coefficients for (1) t (R) and (2) t (R) in calibration (0.9999 and 0.9993, respectively) and prediction (0.9987 and 0.9793, respectively) provided by PLS-1 demonstrate that GC×GC behaviour of PCBs is properly modelled. In particular, the predicted two-dimensional GC×GC chromatogram of 139 PCBs not involved in the calibration stage closely resembles the experimental one. Based on the above lines of evidence, the proposed approach ensures accurate simulation of the whole GC×GC chromatogram of PCBs using experimental determination of only 1/3 retention data of representative congeners.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the determination of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) has been carried out by gas chromatography (GC). However, the gas chromatographic behavior and sensitivity of this type of hydroxylated compounds are not always satisfactory, hence a prior derivatization of the OH-PCBs must be performed. Therefore, the development of liquid chromatographic methods should prove to be a very interesting task aimed at dealing with the instrumental determination of OH-PCBs. Taking into account that octadecylsilane stationary phases are not the most adequate for the separation of isobaric compounds, an amide-type column has been tested. For the development of the method, the Response Surface Methodology was used, based on a Box-Wilson Central Composite experimental design. The initial content of methanol in the mobile phase, the gradient time, and the concentration and the pH value of the buffer were chosen as relevant experimental parameters. A global optimum was obtained by selecting the elution time, the sensitivity and the overall resolution as responses to optimize. The developed method for liquid chromatography presented a very good resolution and sensitivity, and a reasonably short analysis time. In addition, a retention study was conducted in order to survey the different interactions that take place in the separation process, showing that hydrogen bonding is the main interaction between OH-PCBs and the amide-type stationary phase. However, a substantial contribution of dispersion forces was present in methanol contents in the mobile phase below 65\%. Besides, the pH value of the mobile phase was found to be the most important parameter to control the hydrogen bond forces and therefore, to regulate the OH-PCBs separation.},

The approach trims each packet of ions as it leaves and enters each new region. An electrostatic gate allows ions to be kept in the drift tube for numerous cycles, increasing the ability to resolve specified ions. We demonstrate the approach by isolating the [M + 2H](2+) or [M + 3H](3+) charge state of substance P as well as individual trisaccharide isomers from a mixture of melezitose and raffinose.

abstract = {Nontarget analysis and identification of unknown polyhalogenated compounds is important in acquiring a thorough picture of the present pollution status as well as for identifying emerging environmental problems. Such analyses usually require the application of electron ionization mass spectrometry because the resulting mass spectra frequently allow for compound identification. When quadrupoles are used as mass separators, the full scan technique often suffers from low sensitivity along with nonspecificity for polyhalogenated trace compounds which often result in interference by matrix compounds. We have developed a novel nontarget gas chromatography/electron ionization-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring (GC/EI-MS-SIM) method that overcomes these sensitivity and selectivity issues. Our method is based on the fact that the molecular ions and isotope patterns of polyhalogenated compounds involve the most relevant primary information with regard to the structure of polyhalogenated compounds. Additionally, the retention times of polyhalogenated compounds generally increase with increasing molecular weight. The retention time range of polyhalogenated compounds was divided in three partly overlapping segments of 112 u (segment A: m/z 300-412; segment B: m/z 350-462; segment C: m/z 450-562) that were screened in eight GC runs consisting of 15 consecutive SIM ions. This method was tested with a passive water sampler extract known to contain over 30 polyhalogenated compounds according to the sensitive analysis by GC/electron capture negative ion (ECNI)-MS. While none of these polyhalogenated compounds could be detected by GC/EI-MS in full scan mode, our nontarget GC/EI-MS-SIM method allowed for the detection of 38 polyhalogenated compounds. Only seven could be identified by means of reference standards while more than 15 of the unknowns could be traced back to at least the class of compounds based on the mass spectrometric data from the nontarget SIM runs. All compounds identified originated from halogenated natural products. The nontarget GC/EI-MS-SIM method combines the high sensitivity obtainable with quadrupole systems for trace analysis with the structural information essential for the identification of unknown pollutants.},

abstract = {This study compared the sensitivities and matrix effects of four ionization modes and four reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (LC) systems on analyzing estrone (E1), 17beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 4-nonylphenol (NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), bisphenol A (BPA) and their derivatives of dansyl chloride or pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) in water matrixes using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer with selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The four probes were electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) and APCI/APPI; the four LC systems were ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with or without post-column split, a mixed-mode column and two-dimensional LC (2D-LC). Dansylated compounds with ESI at UPLC condition had the most intense signals and less matrix effects of the various combinations of ionization and LC systems. The on-column limits of detection (LODs) of dansylated estrogens by SRM were 0.05-0.20 pg, and the LODs in sewage treatment plant effluent and in river water were 0.23-0.52 and 0.56-0.91 ng/L, respectively. The LODs using selected ion monitoring (SIM) reached low ng/L levels in real samples and measured concentrations were comparable with those of SRM.},

abstract = {A method has been developed for the simultaneous analysis of hydroxylated and methoxylated analogs of tetrabromodiphenyl ethers (OH-tetraBDEs and MeO-tetraBDEs) and of hydroxylated and methoxylated analogs of tetrabromobiphenyl (diOH-tetraBB and diMeO-tetraBB) using high performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (APCI-LC/MS/MS) in negative ion mode. Chromatographic separation was performed on a 150 mm ODS column with acetonitrile:water (9:1, v/v) in mobile phase. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was performed using the precursor [M-H]- ion for hydroxylated analogs, and the [M-Br+O]- ion for tetraBDEs and tetraBB, and their methoxylated analogs. The method was validated using cod liver oil samples spiked with nine analytes (100 ng/g) for linearity (r2 > 0.998), recovery (75-95\%), repeatability (8-36\% RSD), and sensitivity (limits of quantification (LOQ), 0.1-0.25 ng/g lipid for phenolic analytes and 6-80 ng/g lipid for neutral brominated compounds). The APCI-LC/MS/MS was applied to analyze tiger shark and bull shark liver samples, where their concentrations were up to 8 ng/g (lipid weight) for OH-BDEs, whereas they were up to 540 ng/g (lipid weight) for MeO-BDEs. The results were consistent with values determined by electron ionization (EI)-GC/MS. The first detection of 2,2'-dihydroxy-3,3',5,5'-tetrabromobiphenyl (2,2'-diOH-BB80) by this method was in marine sponge from Micronesia. The advantage of the LC/MS/MS method over GC/MS is that it provides rapid and simultaneous determination of OH-BDEs, MeO-BDEs, and their related analogs with a single preparation step and without the involvement of chemical derivatives. Although the method provides the different LOQ ranges between hydroxylated and neutral brominated analogs, future work could apply the method to the full range of PBDE-like contaminants present in the environment and in biota tissues.},

abstract = {Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF-MS) was applied to the comparative metabolic fingerprinting of a wild-type versus a double mutant strain of Escherichia coli lacking the transhydrogenases UdhA and PntAB. Using peak lists generated with the Leco ChromaTOF software as input, we developed retention time correction and data alignment tools (INCA). The accuracy of peak alignment and detection of 1.1- to 4-fold changes in metabolite concentration was validated by a spike-in experiment with 20 standard compounds. A list of 48 significant features that differentiated the two E. coli strains was obtained with an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05. A total of 27 metabolites, mainly from the citrate cycle, were identified. That the signal intensity of the m/z 73 trace of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group reflected true differences in metabolite abundance was confirmed by quantification of pyruvate, fumarate, malate, succinate, alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate, cis-aconitate, myo-inositol, and glucose-6-phosphate using compound specific fragment ions and stable isotope labeled standards. Relative standard deviations for metabolite extraction and GC x GC-TOF-MS analysis of those analytes ranged from 13.2 to 26.3\% for the universal m/z 73 trace and 7.4 to 24.5\% for the analyte specific fragment ion trace.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones are essential hormones for regulating growth and development in humans and wildlife. Methods to monitor precise and low levels of these hormones in serum and tissues are needed to assess overall health, whether from disease considerations or possibly from environmental contaminant exposures. Common and routine methods typically rely upon radioimmunoassays, which can be expensive, and typically only measure thyroxine and 3,3',5-triidothyronine, which can be a limitation in fully evaluating impacts on thyroid regulation. In this study we developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of five thyroid hormones--thyroxine, 3,3',5-triidothyronine, 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine, 3,3'-diiodothyronine, and 3,5-diiodothyronine--in serum samples. The LC-MS/MS parameters were optimized and calibrated over a wide concentration range (1.0-500 ng/mL) with on-column detection limits of 1.5-7.0 pg. With use of spiked bovine serum samples, the mean method recoveries were calculated to be 81.3-111.9\% with relative standard deviations of 1.2-9.6\% at spiking levels ranging from 10 to 100 ng/mL. This method was compared with measurements made by standard radioimmunoassays and with measurements made in a serum Standard Reference Material (SRM 1951b). Development of this method expands the capacity to measure thyroid hormones by including a larger suite of thyroid hormones, and has promising applications for measuring catabolism of thyroid hormones in vitro.},

In this report, we introduce an analytical method focused on endogenous phosphorus metabolites, using nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS) and culture-derived isotope-tagged metabolites as global internal standards for quantitative metabolomics. The nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS method employing a stone-arch microcolumn with amino propyl silica gel achieved good separation of phosphorus metabolites with forty- to hundred-fold increase of sensitivity compared with semimicro flow LC-ESI-MS. The quantitative reproducibility of the nanoLC-ESI-MS has been improved to the point where it is useful for studies of cellular metabolism. Focused metabolomics using culture-derived internal standards was employed to monitor 184 phosphorus-related metabolic changes in cancer cells treated with metabolic enzyme inhibitors, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine. We found marked perturbations of cellular metabolism, of which many, though not all, were in line with the known biological activities of these drugs.},

abstract = {The use of automated flow injection with MS/MS detection for fast quantitation of agrochemicals in food and water samples was demonstrated in this study. Active ingredients from the sulfonylurea herbicide and carbamate insecticide classes were selected as model systems. Samples were prepared using typical procedures from residue methods, placed in an autosampler, and injected directly into a triple quadrupole instrument without chromatographic separation. The technique allows data acquisition in 15 s per injection, with samples being injected every 65 s, representing a significant improvement from the 15-30 min needed in typical HPLC/MS/MS methods. The availability of HPLC systems is an advantage since they can be used in flow-injection mode (bypassing the column compartment). Adequate accuracy, linearity, and precision (R(2) > 0.99 and RSD < 20\%) were obtained using external standards prepared in each control matrix. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) achieved for all analytes was 0.01 mg/kg in food samples and 0.1 ng/mL in water; while limits of detection (LOD) were estimated to be about 0.003 mg/kg and 0.03 ng/mL in food and water, respectively. The advantages and limitations of flow injection MS/MS for ultratrace-level quantitative analysis in complex matrixes are discussed.},

abstract = {A pulsed large-volume injection gas chromatography coupled with electron-capture negative ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry (pLVI-GC/ECNI-qMS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of typical halogenated persistent organic pollutants (H-POPs). By monitoring the characteristic ions of large mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) for each of the H-POPs rather than the chlorine and/or bromine ions, this method avoided the possible interferences arising from the H-POPs themselves and from complex matrices encountered frequently in current GC/qMS methods; and allowed, on the other hand, the use of (13)C-labeled and perdeuterated analogues as internal standards for reliable quantification. pLVI up to 120 microL improved the instrumental detection limits down to pg-fg mL(-1), comparable to or lower than those obtained by the recognized GC/high-resolution MS methods reported so far. The H-POPs including 12 polybrominated diphenyl ethers, 1 polybrominated biphenyl, 10 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 4 hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, and hexachlorobenzene were involved in this study. The method developed demonstrated good linearity (r(2) = 0.9904-0.9999) within 0.5 to 50,000 pg mL(-1) for PCBs and 0.05 to 5000 pg mL(-1) for other H-POPs, and was satisfactory in terms of both repeatability (0.07\%-2.2\%) and reproducibility (2.1\%-8.4\%). It was validated by analyzing a NIST standard reference material SRM-1946 of Lake Superior fish tissue with low 0.01 to 63 pg g(-1) method detection limits, and successfully applied to the determination of the H-POPs in five reference materials of different matrices.},

abstract = {This paper describes the determination and quantitation of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) enantiomers by liquid chromatography-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS). The method is based on the use of a chiral chromatographic column Nucleodex beta-PM (200 mm x 4.0 mm, 5 microm), which allows a good separation between HBCD enantiomers [(+/-)alpha, (+/-)beta and (+/-)gamma] in less than 15 min and the detection is performed by a Q-Trap instrument. Linearity was checked between 0.05 and 25 injected ng. Limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.3-1.5 pg, limits of quantification (LOQs) were between 1 and 6 pg, and both values are lower than those published in the literature applying LC-MS-MS methods. The method was applied to sediment samples collected along the Cinca River, a tributary of the Ebro River (northeast of Spain). Samples were extracted and purified following a pressurized liquid extraction method. LODs of the method were between 0.12 and 5.61 ng/g and LOQs, from 0.38 to 1.87 ng/g. Total HBCD levels in these sediments ranged from not detected to 2660 ng/g dry weight. Enantiomeric fractions (EFs) were calculated and compared with EF obtained from standard injections. It is important to note that calculated EFs were corrected using (2)H(18)-labeled HBCD standards, in order to compensate matrix effect. EFs obtained in sediment samples suggested a higher presence of (+)alpha-HBCD and (+)gamma-HBCD in technical mixture, this suggests that it is not a racemic mixture.},

This algorithm uses the output of the instrument control software, ChromaTOF, as its input data. It detects and merges multiple peak entries of the same metabolite into one peak entry in each input peak list. After a z-score transformation of metabolite retention times, DISCO selects landmark peaks from all samples based on both two-dimensional retention times and mass spectrum similarity of fragment ions measured by Pearson's correlation coefficient. A local linear fitting method is employed in the original two-dimensional retention time space to correct retention time shifts. A progressive retention time map searching method is used to align metabolite peaks in all samples together based on optimization of the Euclidean distance and mass spectrum similarity. The effectiveness of the DISCO algorithm is demonstrated using data sets acquired under different experiment conditions and a spiked-in experiment.},

abstract = {Here we propose a novel microarray data analysis method applicable to evaluation of the chemical effects on wild animals. First, we analyzed correlations between log-transformed hepatic 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels and probe signals detected in wild cormorant liver to screen contaminant-responsive genes. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using the screened probes. Third, these probes were divided into two groups based on our PCA result. Finally, we calculated Euclidian distance of signals, which is equivalent to variance of gene expressions, in each probe set, and analyzed the relationship between log-transformed hepatic TEQ levels and Euclidian distances. A probe set whereby the calculated Euclidian distance was positively correlated with TEQ levels, could indicate genes that were directly affected by dioxins or other persistent organic pollutants (POPs), hence they can be used as biomarkers. By contrast, there were a number of probes whereby the Euclidian distance was negatively correlated with TEQ levels. In the latter probe group, the smaller Euclidian distances in highly contaminated individuals could point to changes in physiological activities of wild cormorants. Therefore, our microarray data analysis method will provide new insights into POPs-responsive genes in field-collected samples for toxicogenomics studies.},

Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) including mono-brominated through deca-brominated congeners were qualified and quantified with good linearity (0.9963-0.9998) and repeatability (RSD, 1.1-8.1\%). Multivariable orthogonal experimental design was used to optimize the MAE parameters. Extraction temperature and time were the most significant factors for extraction process. The extractants were cleaned up with SPE method after extraction. Recoveries of spiked blank samples ranged from 72.4\% to 108.4\% for most of the analytes. The method was applied to the determination of PBBs and PBDEs in several kinds of real EEE samples. It was found that no detectable level of PBBs was detected among them. Different contents of PBDEs were tested in the tested samples and the total contents ranged from 25.0 ng g(-1) to 194.0 ng g(-1). The proposed approach demonstrated an environmentally friendly and convenient alternative, which only consumed 10mL hexane to microwave extraction for 10min at 100 degrees C.},

abstract = {The present paper deals with the presentation in a new interpretation of sediment quality assessment. This original approach studies the relationship between ecotoxicity parameters (acute and chronic toxicity) and chemical components (polluting species like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heavy metals) of lake sediments samples from Turawa Lake, Poland by an application of self-organising maps (SOMs) to the monitoring dataset (59 samplesx44 parameters) in order to obtain visual images of the components distributed at each sampling site when all components are included in the classification and data projection procedure. From the SOMs obtained, it is possible to select groups of similar ecotoxicity (either acute or chronic) and to analyse within each one of them the relationship of the other chemicals to the toxicity determining parameters (EC(50) and mortality). Studies have shown, convincingly, that different regions from the Turawa Lake bottom indicate different patterns of ecotoxicity related to various chemical pollutants, such as the "heptachlor-B" pattern, "pesticide and PAH" pattern, "structural" pattern or "PCB congeners" pattern. Thus, an easy way of multivariate analysis of small datasets with ecotoxicity parameters involved becomes possible. Additionally, a distinction between the effects of pollution on acute and chronic toxicity seems reasonable.},

The method is based on gas chromatography coupled to low-resolution mass spectrometry in negative ion chemical ionization mode. It allows determination of these compounds at concentration levels lower than 10(-14)g. A programmed temperature vaporization injector has been used to ensure maximum compound transfer to the chromatographic column while maintaining low thermal degradation levels of the more brominated congeners. Selectivity was increased by modification of the MS source parameters for optimization of the abundance of the high mass fragment ions. Under optimized condition, good repeatability (1.7-9.1\%) and reproducibility (4.1-20\%), and low detection limits, ranging between 1.5 and 15 pg ml(-1), were obtained. These features afforded reliable quantification of these compounds in snow and human samples at the concentrations in which these compounds are found.},

abstract = {Characterization of prenatal exposure to hazardous chemicals most often relies upon the analysis of cord blood. However, human placenta is an appropriate tissue alternative with noteworthy advantages. Owing to analytical challenges, reports on placental levels of toxic chemicals are limited. The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable, cost-effective, and relatively fast and simple method to extract polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) from human placenta for analysis using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) method was optimized for the extraction and analysis of 43 PBDEs (including BDE209) from human placenta samples. Different sorbents, sample conditions, grinding methods, elution solvents, and single and repeated extractions were compared for their effects on the extraction efficiency. The performance of the optimized method was validated by analyzing spiked placenta samples and a standard reference material of fish tissue. Congener specific PBDE recovery ranged from 91\% to 114\% for the spiked samples and 89\% to 115\% for a standard reference material (SRM) of fish tissue. The optimized MSPD procedure was compared with two conventional extraction methods. The extraction efficiency of MSPD was found to be comparable with that of the traditional Soxhlet method and superior to that using a liquid extraction method. Twenty two PBDEs were detected in all of the five samples collected in Chicago in 2008. This is the first description of PBDEs detected in human placentas in the U.S.},

abstract = {Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is found globally as an environmental contaminant and is highly bioaccumulative in exposed biota including humans. However, there is a dearth of environmental information on the isomeric profile of PFOS, especially in biological samples, which requires suitable analysis methods for the identification and quantification of ultratrace amounts. In the present study, a novel method was developed that incorporates clean up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) WAX cartridges and in-port derivatization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to identify and quantitatively determine linear PFOS (L-PFOS) and branched (monotrifluoromethyl and bistrifluoromethyl) isomers in PFOS technical product and in environmentally relevant biological samples. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) was used for derivatization via an in situ pyrolytic alkylation reaction that occurred in the GC injector and generated butyl PFOS isomer derivatives. In addition to L-PFOS, ten branched PFOS isomers were identified in the technical product. The environmental relevance of branched PFOS isomers in addition to L-PFOS was evidenced by the presence of six branched and L-PFOS in representative herring gull and double-crested cormorant egg, and polar bear liver and plasma samples from the Great Lakes and Arctic, respectively. For all PFOS isomers in the technical product and biota samples the method demonstrated high sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 ng/mL, with exception of L-PFOS where the LOD was 1.46 ng/mL. For the biotic samples, the method detection limits (MDLs) were slightly higher than the LODs and ranged from 0.09 to 0.46 ng/g wet weight (w.w.) with exception of L-PFOS (MDL = 6.87 ng/g w.w.).},

In the present method, derivatization with dansyl chloride was employed, and all the derivertized target compounds were well resolved on a 100mm Xbridge C18 column with acetonitrile and 0.1\% formic acid as the mobile phases. Purification procedures, such as liquid-liquid extraction and silica-gel chromatography, were applied to reduce matrix effects in the sample extract and remove excess derivatizing reagents, thus permitting selective and sensitive detection of the target phenolic compounds. The limit of quantification for all analytes, with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 10, was 2-30 pg/g (plasma weight) except for 6-OH-BDE-137 (30 pg/g) and 3-BRP (60 pg/g). The method was validated for recoveries (68-100\%), accuracy (84-110\%) and precision (3.7-11\%) using charcoal-stripped bovine blood plasma spiked with all target compounds (500 and 5000 pg/mL). Finally, the method was applied to analyze six blood plasma samples from frogs and cormorants, where two natural estrogens, one BPA, one OH-PBDE and four BRPs were detected. The greatest total concentrations of estrogens coincided with the least total concentrations of other phenolic compounds for both species. The proposed method based on derivatization followed by LC-MS/MS provides a novel method to simultaneously monitor multiple groups of phenolic compounds in blood plasma.},

abstract = {Cultural heritage represents a bridge between the contemporary society and the past populations, and a strong collaboration between archaeologists, art historians and analysts may lead to the decryption of the information hidden in an ancient object. Quantitative elemental compositional data play a key role in solving questions concerning dating, provenance, technology, use and the relationship of ancient cultures with the environment. Nevertheless, the scientific investigation of an artifact should be carried out complying with some important constraints: above all the analyses should be as little destructive as possible and performed directly on the object to preserve its integrity. Laser ablation sampling coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) fulfils these requirements exhibiting comparably strong analytical performance in trace element determination. This review intends to show through the applications found in the literature how valuable is the contribution of LA-ICP-MS in the investigation of ancient materials such as obsidian, glass, pottery, human remains, written heritage, metal objects and miscellaneous stone materials. The main issues related to cultural heritage investigation are introduced, followed by a brief description of the features of this technique. An overview of the exploitation of LA-ICP-MS is then presented. Finally, advantages and drawbacks of this technique are critically discussed: the fit for purpose and prospects of the use of LA-ICP-MS are presented.},

We recently demonstrated that when administered to female rat by oral route, DBDE is efficiently absorbed, with the highest residual concentrations found in two endocrine glands, namely the adrenal glands and the ovaries. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging, a technique usually used for the study of endogenous compounds, was applied for the first time to a persistent organic pollutant, allowing to detect and to precisely localize DBDE residues in these two target tissues. The detection of the bromide ion ((81)Br isotope) by TOF-SIMS mass spectrometry imaging allowed us to demonstrate a marked cortical tropism of DBDE residues for the adrenal glands in female rats dosed per os 2 mg·kg(-1) DBDE, daily, over 96 h. In ovaries, DBDE residues were found to be concentrated in spots corresponding to part of the corpora lutea. Hepatic residues of DBDE were found to be homogeneously distributed. Due to the intrinsic toxicity of DBDE, its accumulation in the adrenal glands and the ovaries may be connected to the mechanisms of actions by which DBDE could trigger endocrine disruption in mammals.},

BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, BDE-183, and BDE-209 were baseline-resolved under isocratic conditions in 92:8 methanol/water (v/v). Negative-ion atmospheric pressure photoionization (NI-APPI) with a toluene dopant produced precursor ions corresponding to [M-Br+O](-) for the eight congeners studied. Each congener was quantified by tandem mass spectrometry through a unique multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transition. On-column limits of detection were between 2.4 and 27.8 pg for the eight congeners studied, with an intra-day method precision of 9\%. The LC/NI-APPI/MS/MS method was validated for the analysis of the eight PBDE congeners in NIST SRM 2585 (Organics in House Dust). Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with subsequent LC/NI-APPI/MS/MS analysis afforded quantitative recovery for all eight PBDE congeners with recoveries ranging from 92.7 to 113\%. The liquid-phase separation of the LC/NI-APPI/MS/MS method is not prone to the thermal degradation issues that plague splitless GC based analyses of highly brominated PBDEs such as BDE-209.},

abstract = {One of the major obstacles in metabolomics is the identification of unknown metabolites. We tested constraints for reidentifying the correct structures of 29 known metabolite peaks from GCT premier accurate mass chemical ionization GC-TOF mass spectrometry data without any use of mass spectral libraries. Correct elemental formulas were retrieved within the top-3 hits for most molecular ion adducts using the "Seven Golden Rules" algorithm. An average of 514 potential structures per formula was downloaded from the PubChem chemical database and in-silico-derivatized using the ChemAxon software package. After chemical curation, Kovats retention indices (RI) were predicted for up to 747 potential structures per formula using the NIST MS group contribution algorithm and corrected for contribution of trimethylsilyl groups using the Fiehnlib RI library. When matching the range of predicted RI values against the experimentally determined peak retention, all but three incorrect formulas were excluded. For all remaining isomeric structures, accurate mass electron ionization spectra were predicted using the MassFrontier software and scored against experimental spectra. Using a mass error window of 10 ppm for fragment ions, 89\% of all isomeric structures were removed and the correct structure was reported in 73\% within the top-5 hits of the cases.},

@article{Denery2010,
abstract = {Large-scale proteomic and metabolomic technologies are increasingly gaining attention for their use in the diagnosis of human disease. In order to ensure the statistical power of relevant markers, such analyses must incorporate a large number of representative samples. While in a best-case scenario these samples are collected through a study design that is specifically tailored for the desired analysis, often studies must rely upon the analysis of large numbers of previously banked samples that may or may not have complete and accurate documentation of their associated collection and storage methods. In this study, several human blood matrices were analyzed and compared for the quality of metabolomic output. The sample types that were tested include plasma prepared with a variety of anticoagulants and serum collected by venipuncture and capillary blood collection protocols. Analysis with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed only subtle differences between the various plasma preparation methods. Differences between the serum and plasma samples appear to be largely peptide/protein-based and are consistent with the biological distinction of the two matrices. Interestingly, the small molecule lysophosphatidylinositol was found to be in higher abundance in plasma, as a possible consequence of the effect of the intrinsic clotting cascade on adjacent metabolic pathways. Comparison of the small-molecule profiles of the capillary- and venipuncture-collected samples revealed 23 statistically significant compound differences between these sample types. Most of these features can be attributed to surfactants and detergents used to pretreat the skin in order to maintain the sterility of sample collection. However, several have identical mass and molecular formulas as endogenous human metabolites and could be erroneously attributed to actual metabolic perturbations. Understanding the extent of these matrix effects is important for control of systematic bias and ensuring the quality of metabolomic analysis.},

abstract = {It is well documented and experimentally confirmed that hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) tend to associate with several anions forming different adducts that can affect the sensitivity and the accuracy of the determinations. In the present work, two different approaches for HBCD determination have been optimised and characterised based on their repeatability and intermediate precision, linear calibration ranges, sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification and application to commercial food samples. Both methods involve the use of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to a liquid chromatograph and the addition of different ammonium salts to the mobile phase, i.e. ammonium chloride or ammonium acetate, in order to encourage (Cl method) or try to inhibit (Ac method), respectively, the formation of the chlorine adducts of the molecular ion. Precision of the two methods investigated was similar and both approaches presented a comparable behaviour for the analysis of food samples. However, the Cl method showed higher sensitivity and the limits of detection (0.23-0.41 pg on column) and quantification (0.77-1.35 pg on column) were up to 14 times lower than those obtained applying the Ac method. All these facts make the Cl method the best choice for the quantification of HBCDs in food samples with low concentration levels.},

For this review we chose alkylphenol ethoxylates, bisphenol A, bisphenol F, and their degradation products and halogenated derivatives, which are considered important environmental contaminants. Additionally, some related compounds such as bisphenol diglycidylethers were included. Growing attention has been paid to the mass spectrometric characterization of these compounds and the instrumentation and strategies used for their quantification and confirmation. The current use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methodologies with different mass spectrometers and ionization and monitoring modes is discussed. Practical aspects with regards to the use of these analytical techniques, such as derivatizing reagents in GC-MS, ion suppression in LC-MS, and the most problematic aspects of quantification, are included in the discussion.},

abstract = {Gas chromatography/multiphoton ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/MPI/TOF-MS) was developed for trace analysis of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). The use of an ultraviolet femtosecond laser (266 nm) allowed the sensitive, as well as selective, determination of PCDD/Fs with short singlet-excited-state lifetimes; the detection limit was 19 fg for 1,3,6,8-tetraCDF. Performance of the analytical instrument was examined and was ascertained to be satisfactory for all the criteria (K0311) prescribed by the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS). The relative ionization efficiencies of (12)C-native PCDD/Fs against (13)C-labeled PCDD/Fs were 1.002 +/- 0.012. This suggests that (13)C-labeled isotopes can be used as internal standards with no intensity calibration and that the concentrations of PCDD/Fs can be determined to within an error of ca. 1\%. In addition, multiphoton ionization provides negligible levels of background interference for the real soil samples even with curtailed pretreatment. The toxicity equivalence (TEQ) of the real sample was determined using GC/MPI/TOF-MS for performance evaluation against high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The results suggest equivalent or even superior performance for GC/MPI/TOF-MS, due to low background interference and to the ability to check the reliability of the assignment from the intensity distribution of the isotope peaks.},

In this work, the application of an automatic TD-GC-MS instrument for the determination of particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is evaluated. This device offers the advantage of allowing the analysis of either gaseous or particulate organics without any modification. Once the thermal desorption conditions for PAH extraction were optimised, the method was verified on NIST standard reference material (SRM) 1649a urban dust, showing good linearity, reproducibility and accuracy for all target PAHs. The method has been applied to PM10 and PM2.5 samples collected on quartz fibre filters with low volume samplers, demonstrating its capability to quantify PAHs when only a small amount of sample is available.},

The observed pesticides, belonging to the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), were from different chemical classes. A comparative study with electron impact (EI) ionization was also carried out (both techniques in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode). The programmed temperature vaporizer (PTV) injector in solvent vent mode and narrow-bore column (15mx0.15mm I.D.x0.15microm film of 5\% diphenyl 95\% dimethylsiloxane stationary phase) were used for effective and fast separation. Heptachlor (HPT) as internal standard (I.S.) was applied for the comparison of results obtained from absolute and normalized peak areas. Non-fatty food matrices were investigated. Fruit (apple - matrix-matched standards; orange, strawberry, plum - real samples) and vegetable (lettuce - real sample) extracts were prepared by a quick and effective QuEChERS sample preparation technique. Very good results were obtained for the characterization of fast GC-NCI-MS method analysing EDCs pesticides. Analyte response was linear from 0.01 to 150microgkg(-1) with the R(2) values in the range from 0.9936 to 1.0000 (calculated from absolute peak areas) and from 0.9956 to 1.0000 (calculated from peak areas normalized to HPT). Instrument limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were found at pgmL(-1) level and for the majority of analytes were up to three orders of magnitude lower for NCI compared to EI mode. In both ionization modes, repeatability of measurements expressed as relative standard deviation (RSDs) was less than 10\% which is in very good agreement with the criterion of European Union.},

Industrial pollutants that can be found in indoor air may be of very different types and origin, belonging to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) categories. Several compounds have been classified into the priority organic pollutants (POPs) class such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/PCDFs) and related polychlorinated compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Many of these compounds are partially associated to the air gas phase, but also to the suspended particulate matter. Furthermore, settled dust can act as a concentrator for the less volatile pollutants and has become a matrix of great concern for indoors contamination. Main literature considered in this review are papers from the last 10 years reporting analytical developments and applications regarding VOCs, aldehydes and other carbonyls, PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, and PAHs in the indoor environment. Sample collection and pretreatment, analyte extraction, clean-up procedures, determination techniques, performance results, as well as compound concentrations in indoor samples, are summarized and discussed. Emergent contaminants and pesticides related to the industrial development that can be found in indoor air are reviewed in a second part in this volume.},

Here, we show that addition of each of the various modifiers (DMF, thiodiglycol, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and N-methylpyrrolidone) can significantly increase the charge states of proteins up to 78 kDa. Moreover, incorporation of the same modifiers into reversed-phase liquid chromatography solvents improves sensitivity, charging, and chromatographic resolution for intact proteins.},

abstract = {In this study we developed a GC-MS method for the analysis of priority pollutants, personal care products (PCPs) and other emerging contaminants in waters using large volume injection with backflushing. Analyses are performed in the SIM/scan mode, so that in addition to the targeted organic contaminants, this method allows the simultaneous screening of non-target compounds. The scan data are analysed using Deconvolution Reporting Software (DRS) which screens the results for 934 organic contaminants. Deconvolution helps identify contaminants that are buried in the chromatogram by co-extracted materials and significantly reduces chromatographic resolution requirements, allowing shorter analysis times. All compounds have locked retention times and we can continually update and extend the mass spectral library including new compounds. Linearity and limits of detection in SIM and full-scan mode were studied. Method detection limits (MDLs) in effluent wastewater ranged in most of the cases from 1 to 36 ng/L in SIM mode and from 4 to 66 ng/L in full-scan mode; while in river water from 0.4 to 14 and 2-29 ng/L in SIM and full-scan mode, respectively. We obtained a linearity of the calibration curves over two orders of magnitude. The method has been applied to the screening of a large number of organic contaminants--not only to a subset of targets--in urban wastewaters from different wastewater treatment plants and also in river waters. Most of the target compounds were detected at concentration levels ranging from 11 to 8697 ng/L and from 7 to 1861 ng/L in effluent wastewater and river waters, respectively. Additionally, a group of 12 new compounds were automatically identified using the AMDIS and NIST libraries. Other compounds, such as the 4-amino musk xylene, a synthetic fragrance metabolite, which was not included in the databases, but has been manually searched in the full-scan chromatograms.},

abstract = {This work presents an exploratory study of the photochemical degradation process of decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) and gives an interpretation of the kinetic pathway, species and effects of the key factors involved in the degradation process. Use of lowly brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) has been banned by the EU and there seems to be evidence of the photolytic degradation of highly brominated PBDEs into lowly brominated congeners. Hence, the importance of knowing the photodegradation process of decaBDE. The photodegradation was investigated under UV light by UV-spectrophotometric monitoring. A novel hybrid data analysis approach, based on the combination of hard- and soft-spectrophotometric multivariate curve resolution, was applied to elucidate the mechanism of the degradation process, to resolve kinetic profiles and pure spectra of the photodegradation products and to evaluate the rate constants. The photodegradation process could be described with a kinetic model based on three consecutive first-order reactions and a decrease of the degradation process was observed as solvent polarity increased. Complementary identification of photodegradation products by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using negative chemical ionization (GC-NCI-MS) is attempted. This work presents a novel attempt of describing in a comprehensive way the photochemical degradation process of decaBDE, with all successive steps and related rate constants. This study proves also the potential of the proposed hybrid data analysis methodology as a general strategy to interpret the evolution of these photochemical reactions.},

abstract = {The study proposes an analytical method to quantify 10 alkylphenols and 12 pesticides at ultra-trace levels by liquid chromatography in reverse mode coupled to positive electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry. The extraction procedure from environmental solids was optimised by pressurised liquid extraction using acetonitrile:isopropanol (1:1, v/v). The influence of several extraction experimental factors, temperature, pressure, duration and number of cycles, related to the PLE was investigated by an original and efficient chemometric approach. The optimised extraction method (80 degrees C, 40 bar, 10 min, 1 cycle) exhibited recoveries between 67 and 127\% with RSD mostly under 13\%. The whole method was applied to real samples: sludge, suspended materials, atmospheric fallouts and roof deposit. Pollutant levels were between 1 microg kg(-1) and 5.9 mg kg(-1).},

(13)C-BDE-47, (13)C-BDE-99, (13)C-BDE-153, BDE-128, and (13)C-BDE-209 were used as internal standards, while (13)C-BDE-100 was used as a syringe standard. Separated analytes were ionized using an atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) source equipped with a 10 eV krypton lamp and operated in negative ion mode. [M-Br + O](-) ions were monitored as precursor ions for all studied PBDEs, except for BDE-208 and BDE-209 which produced higher intensity at the [C(6)Br(5)O](-) ion cluster. [Br](-) ions were monitored as fragment ions for all target compounds. Method detection limits ranged from 12 to 30 pg. The method was applied to determination of PBDEs in standard reference material (SRM 2585), and favorable results were obtained. Unlike GC methods, no thermal degradation was encountered in the analysis of higher brominated PBDEs. This rendered the method useful for quantification of BDE-209 debromination products. The method also allows the use of (13)C-labeled internal standards, which compensate for instrumental fluctuations and matrix-related ion suppression or enhancement.},

@article{Grover2009,
abstract = {Research into the analysis and monitoring of steroidal estrogens has grown significantly over the last decade, resulting in the emergence of a range of applicable techniques. In this study, three popular techniques, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) for the analysis of three highly potent steroidal estrogens in the aquatic environment have been compared. It has been observed that overall, the three techniques appear comparable in generating similar estrogen concentrations for river and effluent samples. Of the three techniques, the GC-MS technique is the simplest to operate, but fails to detect the estrogens at the lower-end of environmentally relevant concentrations. The tandem MS techniques are more selective than MS, and therefore able to detect lower concentration levels of the three steroidal estrogens of interest. However, the LC-MS-MS technique is more susceptible to matrix interferences for the analysis of samples, resulting in a reduction of the signal-to-noise ratio and a subsequent reduction in reliability and stability compared to GC-MS-MS. With the GC-MS-MS technique offering increased selectivity, the lowest limits of detection, and no false positive identification, it is recommended to be the preferred analytical technique for routine analysis of estrogens in environmental water samples.},

@article{VanLeeuwen2008,
abstract = {Environmental chemists have been challenged for over 30 years to analyse complex mixtures of halogenated organic pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated furans (PCDD/Fs). Gas chromatography (GC) often proved to be the method of choice because of its high resolution. The recent developments in the field of comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GCxGC) show that this technique can provide much more information than conventional (single-column) GC. Large volume injection (e.g. by programmed temperature vaporiser, or on-column injection) can be employed for the injection of tens of microliters of sample extract, in that way substantially improving the detection limits. Electron-capture detection (ECD) is a sensitive detection method but unambiguous identification is not possible and misidentification easily occurs. Mass spectrometric (MS) detection substantially improves the identification and the better the resolution (as with MS/MS, time-of-flight (TOF) MS and high-resolution (HR)MS), the lower the chances of misidentification are. Unfortunately, this comes only with substantially higher investments and maintenance costs. Co-extracted lipids, sulphur and other interferences can disturb the GC separation and detection leading to unreliable results. Extraction, and more so, sample clean-up and fractionation, are crucial steps prior to the GC analysis of these pollutants. Recent developments in sample extraction and clean-up show that selective pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) is an effective and efficient extraction and clean-up technique that enables processing of multiple samples in less than 1h. Quality assurance tools such as interlaboratory studies and reference materials are very well established for PCDD/Fs and PCBs but the improvement of that infrastructure is needed for brominated flame retardants, PCAs and toxaphene.},

abstract = {Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is found globally as an environmental contaminant and is highly bioaccumulative in exposed biota including humans. However, there is a dearth of environmental information on the isomeric profile of PFOS, especially in biological samples, which requires suitable analysis methods for the identification and quantification of ultratrace amounts. In the present study, a novel method was developed that incorporates clean up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) WAX cartridges and in-port derivatization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to identify and quantitatively determine linear PFOS (L-PFOS) and branched (monotrifluoromethyl and bistrifluoromethyl) isomers in PFOS technical product and in environmentally relevant biological samples. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) was used for derivatization via an in situ pyrolytic alkylation reaction that occurred in the GC injector and generated butyl PFOS isomer derivatives. In addition to L-PFOS, ten branched PFOS isomers were identified in the technical product. The environmental relevance of branched PFOS isomers in addition to L-PFOS was evidenced by the presence of six branched and L-PFOS in representative herring gull and double-crested cormorant egg, and polar bear liver and plasma samples from the Great Lakes and Arctic, respectively. For all PFOS isomers in the technical product and biota samples the method demonstrated high sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 ng/mL, with exception of L-PFOS where the LOD was 1.46 ng/mL. For the biotic samples, the method detection limits (MDLs) were slightly higher than the LODs and ranged from 0.09 to 0.46 ng/g wet weight (w.w.) with exception of L-PFOS (MDL = 6.87 ng/g w.w.).},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to identify commercial pharmaceuticals that might be persistent and bioaccumulative (P\&B) and that were not being considered in current wastewater and aquatic environmental measurement programs. We developed a database of 3193 pharmaceuticals from two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) databases and some lists of top ranked or selling drugs. Of the 3193 pharmaceuticals, 275 pharmaceuticals have been found in the environment and 399 pharmaceuticals were, based upon production volumes, designated as high production volume (HPV) pharmaceuticals. All pharmaceuticals that had reported chemical structures were evaluated for potential bioaccumulation (B) or persistence (P) using quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) or scientific judgment. Of the 275 drugs detected in the environment, 92 were rated as potentially bioaccumulative, 121 were rated as potentially persistent, and 99 were HPV pharmaceuticals. After removing the 275 pharmaceuticals previously detected in the environment, 58 HPV compounds were identified that were both P\&B and 48 were identified as P only. Of the non-HPV compounds, 364 pharmaceuticals were identified that were P\&B. This study has yielded some interesting and probable P\&B pharmaceuticals that should be considered for further study.},

abstract = {A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunosensor was developed for the determination of the insecticide carbaryl and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), the main metabolite of the insecticide chlorpyrifos and of the herbicide triclopyr. The detection was based on a competitive conjugate-immobilized immunoassay format using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Hapten conjugates were covalently immobilized, via thioctic acid self-assembled monolayer (SAM), onto the gold electrode sensitive surface of the quartz crystal. This covalent immobilization allowed the reusability of the modified electrode surface for at least one hundred and fifty assays without significant loss of sensitivity. The piezoimmunosensor showed detection limits (analyte concentrations producing 10\% inhibition of the maximum signal) of 11 and 7 microg l(-1) for carbaryl and TCP, respectively. The sensitivity attained (I(50) value) was around 30 microg l(-1) for both compounds. Linear working ranges were 15-53 microg l(-1) for carbaryl and 13-83 microg l(-1) for TCP. Each complete assay cycle took 20 min. The good sensitivity, specificity, and reusability achieved, together with the short response time, allowed the application of this immunosensor to the determination of carbaryl and TCP in fruits and vegetables at European regulatory levels, with high precision and accuracy.},

abstract = {Arsenic toxicity is a global health problem affecting many millions of people. The main source of exposure is drinking water contaminated by natural geological sources. Current risk assessment is based on the recognized carcinogenicity of arsenic, but neurotoxic risks have been overlooked. In 1955, an outbreak of arsenic poisoning occurred among Japanese infants, with more than 100 deaths. The source was contaminated milk powder produced by the Morinaga company. Detailed accounts of the Morinaga dried milk poisoning were published in Japanese only, and an overview of this poisoning incident and its long-term consequences is therefore presented. From analyses available, the arsenic concentration in milk made from the Morinaga milk powder is calculated to be about 4-7 mg/L, corresponding to daily doses slightly above 500 microg/kg body weight. Lower exposures would result from using diluted milk. Clinical poisoning cases occurred after a few weeks of exposure, with a total dose of about 60 mg. This experience provides clear-cut evidence for hazard assessment of the developmental neurotoxicity. At the present time, more than 600 surviving victims, now in their 50s, have been reported to suffer from severe sequelae, such as mental retardation, neurological diseases, and other disabilities. Along with more recent epidemiological studies of children with environmental arsenic exposures, the data amply demonstrate the need to consider neurotoxicity as a key concern in risk assessment of inorganic arsenic exposure.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of fetal origins of adult disease posits that early developmental exposures involve epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, that influence adult disease susceptibility. In utero or neonatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a high-production-volume chemical used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, is associated with higher body weight, increased breast and prostate cancer, and altered reproductive function. This study shows that maternal exposure to this endocrine-active compound shifted the coat color distribution of viable yellow agouti (Avy) mouse offspring toward yellow by decreasing CpG (cytosine-guanine dinucleotide) methylation in an intracisternal A particle retrotransposon upstream of the Agouti gene. CpG methylation also was decreased at another metastable locus, the CDK5 activator-binding protein (CabpIAP). DNA methylation at the Avy locus was similar in tissues from the three germ layers, providing evidence that epigenetic patterning during early stem cell development is sensitive to BPA exposure. Moreover, maternal dietary supplementation, with either methyl donors like folic acid or the phytoestrogen genistein, negated the DNA hypomethylating effect of BPA. Thus, we present compelling evidence that early developmental exposure to BPA can change offspring phenotype by stably altering the epigenome, an effect that can be counteracted by maternal dietary supplements.},

Astronaut explorers face distinctive health challenges and limited resources for rescue and medical care during space operation. A central goal of space toxicology is to protect the health of the astronaut by assessing potential chemical exposures during spaceflight and setting safe limits that will protect the astronaut against chemical exposures while in a physiologically altered state. In order to maintain sustained occupation in space on the International Space Station (ISS), toxicological risks must be assessed and managed within the context of isolation, continuous exposures, reuse of air and water, limited rescue options, and the need to use highly toxic compounds for propulsion and other purposes. As we begin to explore other celestial bodies, in situ toxicological risks, such as inhalation of reactive mineral dusts, must also be managed.},

@article{jagannath2008eggshell,
abstract = {1 Persistent pesticide residues remain a significant environmental pollutant, reducing breeding success of predatory birds even where such pesticides have been banned for many years. The ability to detect such residues inexpensively without destructive sampling would be a valuable tool for ecotoxicological monitoring. We suggest that assaying eggshell colour might provide such a tool. 2 Recent studies have revealed two mechanisms affecting eggshell pigmentation in, and believed to be specific to, passerine birds. In the great tit Parus major, reddish protoporphyrin speckles on their otherwise white eggs coincide precisely with thin shell and are related to calcium shortage. In the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, the intensity of the eggshell's blue-green ground-colour (pigment biliverdin) is related to the female's health (immunocompetence) at laying. We studied the effect of the insecticide DDT (notorious for reducing eggshell thickness in raptors by blocking calcium availability to the shell gland) on the eggshell pigmentation of Eurasian sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (Falconiformes), whose eggshells show both protoporphyrin spotting and a blue-green biliverdin-based ground colour. 3 Eggshells showing protoporphyrin spots as an internalized pigment layer also showed a strong correlation between DDE levels (DDT metabolite) and shell thickness. The shells were also significantly thinner at these spots. Eggshell thickness was uncorrelated with DDE levels in eggs that lacked such spotting. 4 The green-ness of the ground colour, related to biliverdin pigment, also increased with DDE levels but, unlike the protoporphyrins, this increase was independent of eggshell thickness. 5 We also noted that the colour of eggs collected before 1930 was consistent with the environmental absence of DDT. 6 Synthesis and applications. DDT occurrence in predatory birds indicates ecosystem-wide contamination. Correlation between eggshell colour and DDT concentration indicates that pigmentation might be used as a non-destructive assay for DDT (which is still in widespread use, particularly for combating malaria) in eggs. Further studies should allow our findings to be applied to other raptor species. Our results corroborate the associations of protoporphyrin pigmentation with shell thinning and biliverdin with female immunocompetence described for passerines, but their occurrence in a falconiform implies that these effects evolved long before the appearance of the order Passeriformes.},

abstract = {Two studies were carried out to examine the impact of maternal fipronil exposure on embryonic and offspring development. In the first study, breeding female zebra finches were orally dosed with single sublethal levels of fipronil (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight) to determine behavioural and developmental consequences on chicks following maternal pesticide exposure. Significant levels of fipronil and fipronil-sulfone residues were detected in eggs laid by females in all dosed groups, however, these were undetectable in eggs laid 13 days after treatment. The level of sulfone detected in eggs was consistently higher than that of the parent fipronil compound. Of the seven eggs laid in the treatment groups, only one (14\%) chick hatched and this was from the lowest dose group. This chick was severely underdeveloped at 10 days of age in comparison to control chicks and fiproles were detected in brain, liver, and adipose tissues collected following euthanasia of this individual. In contrast, there was 100\% hatchability of control group eggs and all chicks fledged nests on schedule. In the second study, domestic chicken eggs were injected with 5.5, 17.5, and 37.5 mg/kg egg weight of fipronil directly into the yolk sac on day 12 of incubation. Treatment did not affect hatching success, however, behavioural and developmental abnormalities were observed in hatchlings from the highest dose group. These chicks also demonstrated reduced feeding rates, as indicated by reduced body mass at 48 h period post hatch. Both fipronil and fipronil-sulfone residues were detected in brain and liver tissue of hatchlings at all pesticide dose levels tested.},

abstract = {A set of biochemical and histological responses was measured in wild gudgeon collected upstream and downstream of urban and pharmaceutical manufacture effluents. These individual end-points were associated to fish assemblage characterisation. Responses of biotransformation enzymes, neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption biomarkers revealed contamination of investigated stream by a mixture of pollutants. Fish from sampled sites downstream of the industrial effluent exhibited also strong signs of endocrine disruption including vitellogenin induction, intersex and male-biased sex-ratio. These individual effects were associated to a decrease of density and a lack of sensitive fish species. This evidence supports the hypothesis that pharmaceutical compounds discharged in stream are involved in recorded endocrine disruption effects and fish population disturbances and threaten disappearance of resident fish species. Overall, this study gives argument for the utilisation of an effect-based monitoring approach to assess impacts of pharmaceutical manufacture discharges on wild fish populations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are some common occupational agents and exposure circumstances for which evidence of carcinogenicity is substantial but not yet conclusive for humans. Our objectives were to identify research gaps and needs for 20 agents prioritized for review based on evidence of widespread human exposures and potential carcinogenicity in animals or humans. DATA SOURCES: For each chemical agent (or category of agents), a systematic review was conducted of new data published since the most recent pertinent International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monograph meeting on that agent. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers were charged with identifying data gaps and general and specific approaches to address them, focusing on research that would be important in resolving classification uncertainties. An expert meeting brought reviewers together to discuss each agent and the identified data gaps and approaches. DATA SYNTHESIS: Several overarching issues were identified that pertained to multiple agents; these included the importance of recognizing that carcinogenic agents can act through multiple toxicity pathways and mechanisms, including epigenetic mechanisms, oxidative stress, and immuno- and hormonal modulation. CONCLUSIONS: Studies in occupational populations provide important opportunities to understand the mechanisms through which exogenous agents cause cancer and intervene to prevent human exposure and/or prevent or detect cancer among those already exposed. Scientific developments are likely to increase the challenges and complexities of carcinogen testing and evaluation in the future, and epidemiologic studies will be particularly critical to inform carcinogen classification and risk assessment processes.},

abstract = {Avian eggs contain substantial levels of various hormones of maternal origin and have recently received a lot of interest, mainly from behavioral ecologists. These studies strongly depend on the measurement of egg hormone levels, but the method of measuring these levels has received little attention. This paper describes the sampling, extraction, and assay of hormones in avian eggs and related methodological problems. The method of sampling is important because hormones are not homogeneously distributed within the egg, and after onset of embryonic development their levels may decrease and increase due to changes in egg structure and secretion or uptake of hormones by the embryo. The extraction of hormones from the yolk and chromatographic separation of different hormones for immunoassays can strongly influence the results because such procedures remove interfering substances such as proteins, lipids, and other hormones and their metabolites, which can cross-react with the antiserum used. Finally, the assay itself needs more validation than many studies report, especially with respect to the accuracy and specificity of the hormone measurements. We conclude that the addressed issues need more attention for the correct interpretation of differences in hormone levels within and between studies.},

abstract = {Objective: Daily adult human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been estimated at less than one µg/kg with virtually complete first pass conjugation in the liver in primates but not mice. We measured serum unconjugated and conjugated BPA levels in adult female rhesus monkeys and mice following oral administration of BPA, and compared findings in mice and monkeys with prior published data in women. Methods: Eleven adult female rhesus macaques were fed 400 µg/kg deuterated BPA daily for seven days. Levels of serum dBPA were analyzed by isotope dilution LC-MS (0.2 ng/ml limit of detection) over 24 h on day 1 and 7. The same dose of BPA was fed to adult female CD-1 mice; other female mice were administered 3H-BPA from 2 to 100,000 µg/kg. Results: In monkeys the maximum serum unconjugated dBPA concentration of 4 ng/ml was reached at 1 h after feeding and declined to low levels by 24 h, with no significant bioaccumulation after 7 daily doses. Adult female mice and rhesus monkeys cleared serum unconjugated BPA at virtually identical rates. There was a linear relationship between administered dose and serum BPA in mice. Conclusions: BPA pharmacokinetics in women, female monkeys and mice is very similar. By comparison with \~{}2 ng/ml serum unconjugated BPA reported in multiple human studies, the average 24 h serum unconjugated BPA concentration of 0.5 ng/ml in both monkeys and mice following a 400-µg/kg oral dose suggests that total daily human exposure is via multiple routes and much higher than previously assumed.},

Preclinical safety assessment of pharmaceuticals for men and women of childbearing potential as well as for pediatric and juvenile indications may require DIT assessments. Draft documents from environmental and chemical regulatory agencies propose strategies that use the rat as a test species and incorporate histopathology and functional testing as endpoints. While there are no guidelines for DIT assessment of pharmaceuticals, current discussions suggest that combining immunotoxicity and developmental and reproductive toxicology studies may serve this purpose. Knowledge of the principles and applications of DIT will facilitate participation in strategy development and effective conduct of relevant studies.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that environmental standardization is the best way to guarantee reproducible results in animal experiments. However, mounting evidence indicates that even subtle differences in laboratory or test conditions can lead to conflicting test outcomes. Because experimental treatments may interact with environmental conditions, experiments conducted under highly standardized conditions may reveal local 'truths' with little external validity. We review this hypothesis here and present a proof of principle based on data from a multilaboratory study on behavioral differences between inbred mouse strains. Our findings suggest that environmental standardization is a cause of, rather than a cure for, poor reproducibility of experimental outcomes. Environmental standardization can contribute to spurious and conflicting findings in the literature and unnecessary animal use. This conclusion calls for research into practicable and effective ways of systematic environmental heterogenization to attenuate these scientific, economic and ethical costs.},

HR tomcod exhibited variants in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (AHR2) that were nearly absent elsewhere. In ligand-binding assays, AHR2-1 protein (common in the HR) was impaired as compared to widespread AHR2-2 in binding TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) and in driving expression in reporter gene assays in AHR-deficient cells treated with TCDD or PCB126. We identified a six-base deletion in AHR2 as the basis of resistance and suggest that the HR population has undergone rapid evolution, probably due to contaminant exposure. This mechanistic basis of resistance in a vertebrate population provides evidence of evolutionary change due to selective pressure at a single locus.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Optimal ciclosporin A (CsA) exposure in kidney transplant recipients is difficult to attain because of variability in CsA pharmacokinetics. A better understanding of the variability in CsA exposure could be a good means of individualizing therapy. Specifically, genetic variability in genes involved in CsA metabolism could explain exposure differences. Therefore, this study is aimed at identifying a relationship between genetic polymorphisms and the variability in CsA exposure, while accounting for non-genetic sources of variability. METHODS: De novo kidney transplant patients (n = 33) were treated with CsA for 1 year and extensive blood sampling was performed on multiple occasions throughout the year. The effects of the non-genetic covariates hematocrit, serum albumin concentration, cholesterol, demographics (i.e., body weight), CsA dose interval, prednisolone dose and genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding ABCB1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and PXR on CsA pharmacokinetics were studied using non-linear mixed effect modeling. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of CsA were described by a two-compartment disposition model with delayed absorption. Body weight was identified as the most important covariate and explained 35\% of the random inter-individual variability in CsA clearance. Moreover, concurrent prednisolone use at a dosage of 20 mg/day or higher was associated with a 22\% higher clearance of CsA, hence lower CsA exposure. In contrast, no considerable genotype effects (i.e., greater than 30-50\%) on CsA clearance were found for the selected genes. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the selected genetic markers explain variability in CsA exposure insufficiently to be of clinical relevance. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring is still required to optimize CsA exposure after administration of individualized doses based on body weight and, as this study suggests, co-administration of prednisolone.},

abstract = {Cardiotoxicity, also referred to as drug-induced cardiac injury (DICI), is an issue associated with the use of some small-molecule kinase inhibitors and antibody based therapies targeting signalling pathways in cancer. Although these drugs have had a major impact on cancer patient survival, data has implicated kinase-targeting agents such as sunitinib, imatinib, trastuzumab and sorafenib in adversely affecting cardiac function in a subset of treated individuals. In many cases adverse cardiac events in the clinic were not anticipated based on pre-clinical safety evaluation of the molecule. In order to support the development of efficacious and safe kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and other indications, new pre-clinical approaches and screens are required to predict clinical cardiotoxicity. Laboratory investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms of heart toxicity induced by these molecules have identified potentially common themes including mitochondrial perturbation and modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase activity. Studies characterising cardiac-specific kinase knockout mouse models have developed our understanding of the homeostatic role of some of these signalling-mediators in the heart. Therefore, when considering kinases as potential future targets or when examining secondary pharmacological interactions of novel kinase inhibitors, these models may help to inform us of the potential adverse cardiac effects in the clinic.},

The SMT has not been rigorously tested, and several lines of evidence raise questions that are not addressed by this theory. Herein, we propose experimental strategies that may validate the SMT. We also call attention to an alternative theory of carcinogenesis, the tissue organization field theory (TOFT), which posits that cancer is a tissue-based disease and that proliferation is the default state of all cells. Based on epistemological and experimental evidence, we argue that the TOFT compellingly explains carcinogenesis, while placing it within an evolutionarily relevant context.

In response to recent reviews of limitations of current concepts and techniques for toxicity testing, this commentary challenges the paradigm that chemicals are directly responsible for DNA damage in the genomic-nuclear DNA in relevant cells of the human body. This challenge is not that mutations do not play roles in human-inherited or somatic diseases but that chemical exposures bring about disease end points by epigenetic mechanisms or by alterations in adult stem cell numbers in utero (ie, the Barker hypothesis) or postnatally, by selecting preexisting mutated cells. Classic concepts, that is, multistage, multimechanism process of carcinogenesis, stem cell theory of cancer, and newer and ignored concepts, such as cancer stem cells and cell-cell communication, will be used to support the view that the toxic effect of chemicals is mediated by nonmutagenic mechanisms at human relevant exposures.},

What are the potential harms to minipigs relative to the harms for dogs and non-human primates and can these harms be reduced more easily in minipigs than in other species? Are there potential benefits resulting from the use of minipigs relative to dogs and non-human primates? In considering the answers to these questions, we present an ethical framework which was developed taking into account the viewpoint of all concerned parties. This ethical matrix provides a framework upon which to identify and explore issues raised by the moral imperative to seek a fair compromise between the differing needs of different interest groups, which includes both the moral agents and the moral patients. The moral agents are the different groups of human stakeholders including society at large, regulatory bodies, industrialists and animal care staff. The moral patients are the laboratory animals, both breeding stock held by the animal supplier, and experimental animals in laboratories. In considering these animals it cannot be assumed that dogs, monkeys and minipigs differ with regard to the pain and suffering that they may experience and undergo when treated in studies designed for safety assessment. On this basis we rejected the argument that minipigs are more acceptable experimental animals than dogs or monkeys despite the fact that their use may prove less offensive to some groups within society at large. Species selection must be made on a case-by-case basis where the benefits are assessed by weighing the scientific evidence relating to the predictivity of the animal model, against the harm that may accrue to the animals both from the test procedures and their lifetime experience within the laboratory environment.},

The key change is basing the assessments on mechanisms and toxicant modes of action. Identifying pathways of toxicity (PoT), especially on a larger scale, evidently requires omics technologies. When the PoT is known, a test battery allowing higher throughput than the current approach can be constructed. Here, we propose an extension of this concept to mapping the entirety of PoT in humans: the human toxome. Mapping the human toxome will allow us, for the first time, to conclusively identify substances as nontoxic or to identify nontoxic concentrations of substances (i.e., concentrations at which no relevant PoT are triggered). The concept is explained, and opportunities and obstacles are discussed, aiming to promote an initiative which will form the core of a Human Toxicology Project to implement Toxicology for the 21st Century.},

Targeted pesticide restrictions in Sri Lanka over the last 20 years have reduced pesticide deaths by 50\% without decreasing agricultural output. However, regulatory decisions have thus far not been based on the human toxicity of formulated agricultural pesticides but on the surrogate of rat toxicity using pure unformulated pesticides. We aimed to determine the relative human toxicity of formulated agricultural pesticides to improve the effectiveness of regulatory policy. We examined the case fatality of different agricultural pesticides in a prospective cohort of patients presenting with pesticide self-poisoning to two clinical trial centers from April 2002 to November 2008. Identification of the pesticide ingested was based on history or positive identification of the container. A single pesticide was ingested by 9,302 patients. A specific pesticide was identified in 7,461 patients; 1,841 ingested an unknown pesticide. In a subset of 808 patients, the history of ingestion was confirmed by laboratory analysis in 95\% of patients. There was a large variation in case fatality between pesticides—from 0\% to 42\%. This marked variation in lethality was observed for compounds within the same chemical and/or WHO toxicity classification of pesticides and for those used for similar agricultural indications. The human data provided toxicity rankings for some pesticides that contrasted strongly with the WHO toxicity classification based on rat toxicity. Basing regulation on human toxicity will make pesticide poisoning less hazardous, preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths globally without compromising agricultural needs. Ongoing monitoring of patterns of use and clinical toxicity for new pesticides is needed to identify highly toxic pesticides in a timely manner.},

abstract = {Neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, attention defi cit disorder, mental retardation, and cerebral palsy are common, costly, and can cause lifelong disability. Their causes are mostly unknown. A few industrial chemicals (eg, lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], arsenic, and toluene) are recognised causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and subclinical brain dysfunction. Exposure to these chemicals during early fetal development can cause brain injury at doses much lower than those aff ecting adult brain function. Recognition of these risks has led to evidence-based programmes of prevention, such as elimination of lead additives in petrol. Although these prevention campaigns are highly successful, most were initiated only after substantial delays. Another 200 chemicals are known to cause clinical neurotoxic eff ects in adults. Despite an absence of systematic testing, many additional chemicals have been shown to be neurotoxic in laboratory models. The toxic eff ects of such chemicals in the developing human brain are not known and they are not regulated to protect children. The two main impediments to prevention of neurodevelopmental defi cits of chemical origin are the great gaps in testing chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity and the high level of proof required for regulation. New, precautionary approaches that recognise the unique vulnerability of the developing brain are needed for testing and control of chemicals.},
annote = {        Laura M Plunkett: Comment in Lancet
In asserting the existence of a “silent pandemic” of ￼developmental neurotoxicity,￼ P Grandjean and P J Landrigan (Dec 16, p 2167) P Grandjean and P Landrigan, Developmental neurotoxicity￼ of industrial chemicals, Lancet        368 (2006), pp. 2167–2178. have apparently forgotten or ignored dose-response principles in their zeal to promote their opinions. In compiling their list of “chemicals known to be neurotoxic in man”, they derive much of their information from occupational exposure studies done when hygiene measures were much less stringent than they are now. Therefore, those results are of limited relevance to assessing general population risks, including those of sensitive populations (pregnant women, infants, children) in whom exposures are much lower. Grandjean and Landrigan's faulty logic is exemplified by ethanol. Abuse during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome, a ￼developmental￼ syndrome with neurological manifestations. However, there are no data to show that maternal exposure to low, environmentally relevant levels of ethanol (ie, concentration in foods) places the fetus at any risk of fetal alcohol syndrome. Risk is a function of dose, even for ￼developmental neurotoxicity. With drugs, to see efficacy, a critical concentration at the target site is needed. The same principle applies to toxicity. Effects at high doses will not be realised at lower doses if the concentration falls below the target site threshold level. If Grandjean and Landrigan's logic is applied to drugs, an “outbreak of cures” would be predicted to be triggered by any dose of any therapeutic agent. Evidence-based medical practice would reject such a homoeopathic belief. Evidence-based toxicology and epidemiology dictates a similar conclusion with respect to Grandjean and Landrigan's allegations of a “pandemic” of ￼developmental neurotoxicity.

Reply from authors:        
Laura Plunkett seems to have missed a main point of our review—ie, that during prenatal and early postnatal development the timing of exposure is at least as crucial as the dose. It is the unique sensitivity of the developing human brain during windows of early vulnerability that accounts for the profound damage caused by minute doses of lead, methylmercury, ethyl alcohol, and probably many other industrial chemicals that have never been properly tested. As we show with the few chemicals that are known to damage brain development, waiting for the production of detailed dose-response relations will promote the continued exposure of developing brains to toxic risks. Norman Saunders and Katarzyna Dziegielewska provide important information on the early development of the blood–brain barrier. Given that intercellular tight junctions between cerebral endothelial cells in the blood–brain barrier are already well developed from early embryonal life, any incomplete development of this barrier will have at most a partial role in the genesis of ￼developmental neurotoxicity.￼ The industrial chemicals that we identified as toxic to the adult brain are obviously capable of passing the mature blood–brain barrier. With regard to these substances, the risk of ￼developmental neurotoxicity￼ would not depend on any assumption of incomplete barrier development. PG has testified on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council in a court case in regard to mercury pollution from a chemical plant in Maine, USA. PJL has testified on behalf of the State of Rhode Island, USA, in a lawsuit against the manufacturers of lead-based paint.
        
        Saunders and Dziegielewska: comment        
P Grandjean and P J Landrigan1 provide a valuable and timely review of industrial chemicals that are thought to have damaging effects if they reach the developing brain. In discussing possible mechanisms that might account for the vulnerability of the developing brain to these agents, Grandjean and Landrigan state “The blood–brain barrier is not completely formed until about 6 months after birth”, citing a paper by Adinolfi.2 This perpetuates the long-standing misconception that “the” blood–brain barrier in the fetus and newborn is immature.The term blood–brain barrier is used to describe a series of physiological mechanisms (inward and outward transport mechanisms) that control the composition and stability of the internal environment of the brain. Underlying these physiological mechanisms is the presence of intercellular tight junctions between cerebral endothelial cells (blood–brain barrier) and between choroid plexus epithelial cells (blood–CSF barrier). The presence of tight junctions is essential for the functional effectiveness of all the physiological barrier mechanisms. Tight junctions between cerebral endothelial and between choroid plexus epithelial cells have been known for decades to exclude the intercellular passage of proteins from blood into brain and CSF.3 The tight junctions at both blood–brain and blood–CSF interfaces are well formed from early embryonic life.4 However, there is a transcellular mechanism in a subpopulation of choroid plexus epithelial cells that transfers proteins from blood to CSF.5 This protein transfer mechanism might be relevant for the entry of some neurotoxic agents into the immature brain. For example, some of the heavy metals listed by Grandjean and Landrigan bind to proteins in plasma and could thus be transported into the brain via the choroid plexus. However, this is a reflection of a ￼developmental￼ specialisation rather than of immaturity.
We declare that we have no conflict of interest.},

abstract = {Recent research has pointed to the developing immune system as a remarkably sensitive toxicologic target for environmental chemicals and drugs. In fact, the perinatal period before and just after birth is replete with dynamic immune changes, many of which do not occur in adults. These include not only the basic maturation and distribution of immune cell types and selection against autoreactive lymphocytes but also changes designed specifically to protect the pregnancy against immune-mediated miscarriage. The newborn is then faced with critical immune maturational adjustments to achieve an immune balance necessary to combat myriad childhood and later-life diseases. All these processes set the fetus and neonate completely apart from the adult regarding immunotoxicologic risk. Yet for decades, safety evaluation has relied almost exclusively upon exposure of the adult immune system to predict perinatal immune risk. Recent workshops and forums have suggested a benefit in employing alternative exposures that include exposure throughout early life stages. However, issues remain concerning when and where such applications might be required. In this review we discuss the reasons why immunotoxic assessment is important for current childhood diseases and why adult exposure assessment cannot predict the effect of xenobiotics on the developing immune system. It also provides examples of developmental immunotoxicants where age-based risk appears to differ. Finally, it stresses the need to replace adult exposure assessment for immune evaluation with protocols that can protect the developing immune system.},

abstract = {Physiological function emerges from complex biomolecular interactions (e.g., protein-protein) and control mechanisms that enable animals to respond and adapt to changes in their environment. Cell injury and pathology induced by pollutants and other stressors appears to involve the gradual and progressive dysfunction of complex biomolecular interactions, resulting in loss of integrated physiological interactions and homeostasis leading to a reduced capacity to respond effectively to stress. In order to determine whether complexity can be used as an indicator of health, the hypothesis that pathology involves a loss of biological complexity has been tested using a generic physiological interaction network. System complexity was evaluated using Eulerian cycles and connectedness (connectance\%) for estimating topological complexity and application of network theory (i.e., analysis of scale-free networks and network diameter). The complexity of the whole system increases when sub-systems, such as detoxication and anti-oxidant protective processes, augmented autophagy, protein degradation and induction of stress proteins, are up-regulated and start to interact significantly as part of a response to low-level stress (i.e., biphasic or hormetic response). However, with increasing severity of stress, cell injury and higher-level functional impairment lead to physiological dysfunction and breakdown of the whole interaction network with consequent loss of complexity. In summary for the model described here, network and graph theory appear to provide a mathematical formalism that can facilitate the system-level interpretation of health and dysfunction in living cells.},

abstract = {Background: Chemicals having estrogenic activity (EA) reportedly cause many adverse health effects, especially at low (pM-nM) doses in fetal and juvenile mammals. Objectives: To determine whether commercially available plastic resins and products, including baby bottles and other products advertised as BPA-free, release chemicals having EA. Materials and Methods: We used a very sensitive, accurate, repeatable, roboticized MCF-7 cell proliferation assay to quantify the EA of chemicals leached into saline or ethanol extracts of many types of commercially available plastic materials, some exposed to common-use stresses (microwaving, UV radiation, and/or autoclaving). Results: Almost all commercially available plastic products we sampled, independent of the type of resin, product, or retail source, leached chemicals having reliably-detectable EA, including those advertised as BPA-free. In some cases, BPA-free products released chemicals having more EA than BPA-containing products. Conclusions: Many plastic products are mischaracterized as being EA-free if extracted with only one solvent and not exposed to common-use stresses. However, we can identify existing, or have developed, monomers, additives or processing agents that have no detectable EA and similar costs. Hence, our data suggest that EA-free plastic products exposed to common-use stresses and extracted by saline and ethanol solvents could be cost-effectively made on a commercial scale, and thereby eliminate a potential health risk posed by most currently-available plastic products that leach chemicals having EA into food products.},

The goal is to ensure that studies are scientifically appropriate and necessary without being redundant, and that tests emphasize toxicological endpoints and exposure durations that are relevant for risk assessment. The ACSA Life Stages Task Force proposes a tiered approach to toxicity testing that assesses a compound's potential to cause adverse effects on reproduction, and that assesses the nature and severity of effects during development and adolescence, with consideration of the sensitivity of the elderly. While incorporating many features from current guideline studies, the proposed approach includes a novel rat reproduction and developmental study with enhanced endpoints and a rabbit development study. All available data, including toxicokinetics, ADME data, and systemic toxicity information, are considered in the design and interpretation of studies. Compared to existing testing strategies, the proposed approach uses fewer animals, provides information on the young animal, and includes an estimation of human exposure potential for making decisions about the extent of testing required.},

abstract = {The efforts of the committee that produced the report on Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century reflected the need to look at the issue of assessing risks to humans from exposure to various chemicals through a lens of 21st century biology. The problem - determining if there is a risk of specific exposures - is as old as humanity; every generation brings its own perspective and tools for examining the problem and coming to answers and solutions. Bringing this generation's tools to bear requires us to see the problem of chemical risk assessment in a different light, both in terms of testing of toxicity pathways in vitro and in the interpretation of the tests for estimating whether exposures will be safe. One key issue will be to assess when pathway perturbations are believed to be excessive, i.e., when they are deemed adverse. Redefinition of adversity based on in vitro testing will require a new perception of dose response functions as probabilities of failures, with multiple underlying processes acting sequentially and in parallel leading to failure at a cellular and an organism level. These dose response relationships for adversity will also require a computational systems biology approach for examining toxicity pathway dynamics and stress pathway overload. While the overall approach of defining adversity for in vitro endpoints and using this definition of adversity for risk assessment can be painted in broad brush strokes, as we have done here for DNA-reactive compounds, it will take implementation with a series of prototypes to show the process in practice.},

Such ‘unpalatability by appropriation’ is common in many invertebrate groups and also found in a few vertebrate groups. However, potentially lethal toxicity by acquisition has so far never been reported for a placental mammal. Here, we describe complex morphological structures and behaviours whereby the African crested rat, Lophiomys imhausi, acquires, dispenses and advertises deterrent toxin. Roots and bark of Acokanthera schimperi (Apocynaceae) trees are gnawed, masticated and slavered onto highly specialized hairs that wick up the compound, to be delivered whenever the animal is bitten or mouthed by a predator. The poison is a cardenolide, closely resembling ouabain, one of the active components in a traditional African arrow poison long celebrated for its power to kill elephants.},

abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the manufacture of plastics, and has been identified in various environmental matrices, including human serum and breast milk. The prevalence of BPA in the environment and the potential exposure to humans underscores the need to more fully understand the fate of BPA in the environment and the resulting effects and toxicity to humans and other organisms. Here we demonstrate that Mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterium vanbaalenii strain PYR-1, are able to O-methylate BPA to its mono- and dimethyl ether derivatives (BPA MME and BPA DME, respectively). The O-methylation of BPA results in metabolites with increased toxicity as shown from differences in survival and occurrence of developmental lesions in developing zebrafish embryos exposed to BPA, BPA MME, and BPA DME. The mono- and dimethyl ether derivatives were more toxic than BPA, resulting in increased mortality at 5 (LC(50) = 0.66 and 1.2 mg L(-1)) and 28 (LC(50) = 0.38, <0.5 mg L(-1)) days post fertilization. Furthermore, exposure to either of the O-methylated metabolites resulted in an increase in the incidence of developmental lesions as compared to BPA exposure. These data illustrate a new mechanism for microbial transformation of BPA, producing metabolites warranting further study to understand their prevalence and effects in the environment.},

abstract = {Mechanistic toxicology has evolved by relying, to a large extent, on methodologies that substitute or complement traditional animal tests. The biotechnology and informatics revolutions of the last decades have made such technologies broadly available and useful, but regulatory toxicology has been slow to embrace these new approaches. Major validation efforts, however, have delivered the evidence that new approaches do not lower safety standards and can be integrated into regulatory safety assessments. Particularly in the EU, political pressures, such as the REACH legislation and the 7th Amendment to the cosmetic legislation, have prompted the need of new approaches. In the US, the NRC vision report calling for a toxicology for the 21st century (and its most recent adaptation by EPA for their toxicity testing strategy) have initiated a debate about how to create a novel approach based on human cell cultures, lower species, high-throughput testing, and modeling. Lessons learned from the development, validation, and acceptance of alternative methods support the creation of a new approach based on identified toxicity pathways. Conceptual steering and an objective assessment of current practices by evidence-based toxicology (EBT) are required. EBT is modeled on evidence-based medicine, which has demonstrated that rigorous systematic reviews of current practices and meta-analyses of studies provide powerful tools to provide health care professionals and patients with the current best scientific evidence. Similarly, a portal for high-quality reviews of toxicological approaches and tools for the quantitative meta-analyses of data promise to serve as door opener for a new regulatory toxicology.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Age- and sex-related susceptibility to adverse drug reactions and disease is a key concern in understanding drug safety and disease progression. We hypothesize that the underlying suite of hepatic genes expressed at various life cycle stages will impact susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. Understanding the basal liver gene expression patterns is a necessary first step in addressing this hypothesis and will inform our assessments of adverse drug reactions as the liver plays a central role in drug metabolism and biotransformation. Untreated male and female F344 rats were sacrificed at 2, 5, 6, 8, 15, 21, 52, 78, and 104 weeks of age. Liver tissues were collected for histology and gene expression analysis. Whole-genome rat microarrays were used to query global expression profiles. RESULTS: An initial list of differentially expressed genes was selected using criteria based upon p-value (p<0.05) and fold-change (+/- 1.5). Three dimensional principal component analysis revealed differences between males and females beginning at 2 weeks with more divergent profiles beginning at 5 weeks. The greatest sex-differences were observed between 8 and 52 weeks before converging again at 104 weeks. K-means clustering identified groups of genes that displayed age-related patterns of expression. Various adult aging-related clusters represented gene pathways related to xenobiotic metabolism, DNA damage repair, and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an underlying role for genes in specific clusters in potentiating age- and sex-related differences in susceptibility to adverse health effects. Furthermore, such a comprehensive picture of life cycle changes in gene expression deepens our understanding and informs the utility of liver gene expression biomarkers.},

abstract = {Drug regulatory agencies should ensure that the benefits of drugs outweigh their risks, but licensed medicines sometimes do not perform as expected in everyday clinical practice. Failure may relate to lower than anticipated efficacy or a higher than anticipated incidence or severity of adverse effects. Here we show that the problem of benefit-risk is to a considerable degree a problem of variability in drug response. We describe biological and behavioural sources of variability and how these contribute to the long-known efficacy-effectiveness gap. In this context, efficacy describes how a drug performs under conditions of clinical trials, whereas effectiveness describes how it performs under conditions of everyday clinical practice. We argue that a broad range of pre- and post-licensing technologies will need to be harnessed to bridge the efficacy-effectiveness gap. Successful approaches will not be limited to the current notion of pharmacogenomics-based personalized medicines, but will also entail the wider use of electronic health-care tools to improve drug prescribing and patient adherence.},

abstract = {Maintaining the viability of populations of plants and animals is a key focus for environmental regulation. Population-level responses integrate the cumulative effects of chemical stressors on individuals as those individuals interact with and are affected by their conspecifics, competitors, predators, prey, habitat, and other biotic and abiotic factors. Models of population-level effects of contaminants can integrate information from lower levels of biological organization and feed that information into higher-level community and ecosystem models. As individual-level endpoints are used to predict population responses, this requires that biological responses at lower levels of organization be translated into a form that is usable by the population modeler. In the current study, we describe how mechanistic data, as captured in adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), can be translated into modeling focused on population-level risk assessments. First, we describe the regulatory context surrounding population modeling, risk assessment and the emerging role of AOPs. Then we present a succinct overview of different approaches to population modeling and discuss the types of data needed for these models. We describe how different key biological processes measured at the level of the individual serve as the linkage, or bridge, between AOPs and predictions of population status, including consideration of community-level interactions and genetic adaptation. Several case examples illustrate the potential for use of AOPs in population modeling and predictive ecotoxicology. Finally, we make recommendations for focusing toxicity studies to produce the quantitative data needed to define AOPs and to facilitate their incorporation into population modeling.Environ. Toxicol.

abstract = {Many widespread and persistent organic pollutants, e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), causing it to translocate to the cell nucleus, where it transactivates target genes. AhR's ability to target the blood-brain barrier is essentially unexplored. We show here that exposing isolated rat brain capillaries to 0.05-0.5 nM TCDD roughly doubled transport activity and protein expression of P-glycoprotein, an ATP-driven drug efflux pump and a critical determinant of drug entry into the CNS. These effects were abolished by actinomycin D or cycloheximide or by the AhR antagonists resveratrol and $\alpha$-naphthoflavone. Brain capillaries from TCDD-dosed rats (1-5 $\mu$g/kg, i.p.) exhibited increased transport activity and protein expression of 3 xenobiotic efflux pumps, P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, and breast cancer resistance polypeptide, as well as expression of Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1, both AhR target genes. Consistent with increased P-glycoprotein expression in capillaries from TCDD-dosed rats, in situ brain perfusion indicated significantly reduced brain accumulation of verapamil, a P-glycoprotein substrate. These findings suggest a new paradigm for the field of environmental toxicology: toxicants acting through AhR to target xenobiotic efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier and thus reduce brain accumulation of CNS-acting therapeutic drugs.-Wang, X., Hawkins, B.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The debate regarding DDT in malaria prevention and human health is polarized. It can be classified into three positions: anti-DDT, centrist-DDT, pro-DDT. OBJECTIVE: To arrive at a synthesis by matching a series of questions on the use of DDT as indoor residual spray (IRS) with literature and insights, and to identify options and opportunities. DISCUSSION: Overall, community health is significantly improved through all available malaria control measures, which includes IRS with DDT. Is DDT 'good'? Yes, as it has saved many lives. Is DDT safe as used in IRS? Recent publications have added to concern - an unqualified statement that DDT used in IRS is safe is therefore untenable. Are inhabitants and applicators exposed? Yes, and to high levels. Should DDT be used? The fact that DDT is 'good' because it saves lives, and 'not safe' because it has health and environmental consequences, raises ethical issues. The evidence of adverse human health effects due to DDT is mounting. However, under certain circumstances malaria control using DDT cannot yet be halted. Therefore, the continued use of DDT poses a paradox recognized by a centrist-DDT position. It is time now, at the very least, to invoke precaution. Precautionary actions could include use and exposure reduction. CONCLUSIONS: There are situations where DDT will provide the best achievable health benefit, but maintaining that DDT is safe ignores the cumulative indications of many studies. In such situations, addressing the paradox from a centrist-DDT position and invoking precaution will help design choices for a healthier life.},

abstract = {The objective of the RETHINK project was to evaluate the potential impact of toxicity testing in the minipig as an alternative approach in regulatory toxicity testing that can contribute to the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing (3Rs). Expert study groups (Working Groups) were assembled to review five different areas relating to the use of minipigs in regulatory safety testing: ethical issues, welfare and animal care, development of new medicines and chemicals, safety testing issues and emerging technologies in safety testing. The conclusions and recommendations of the projects are presented in this article. It is concluded that there are no specific areas where restrictions to the use of minipigs in toxicology are required for welfare reasons. The minipig model is generally acceptable to regulatory authorities, provided it is adequately justified. The minipig is an interesting model for safety testing since there are numerous anatomical, physiological, genetic and biochemical similarities to humans. In addition many features of the minipig make it a practical and flexible model for safety testing. The use of the minipig in development of products does not bring any financial penalty in terms of the cost of testing. Benefits in terms of 3Rs can be identified in terms of life-cycle analysis of the use of minipigs compared to dogs and non-human primates. Finally the minipig (unlike the dog) is well positioned to take advantage of genomics and gene manipulation technologies. Specific recommendations for further research are made, which could bring 3Rs benefits. To deploy the minipig to the best advantage, clear information is needed about the predictivity of the minipig for human toxicities, and focussed action to define the potential role of the minipig in testing of biologics.},

@article{Kaminen-Ahola2010,
abstract = {Recent studies have shown that exposure to some nutritional supplements and chemicals in utero can affect the epigenome of the developing mouse embryo, resulting in adult disease. Our hypothesis is that epigenetics is also involved in the gestational programming of adult phenotype by alcohol. We have developed a model of gestational ethanol exposure in the mouse based on maternal ad libitum ingestion of 10\% (v/v) ethanol between gestational days 0.5-8.5 and observed changes in the expression of an epigenetically-sensitive allele, Agouti viable yellow (A(vy)), in the offspring. We found that exposure to ethanol increases the probability of transcriptional silencing at this locus, resulting in more mice with an agouti-colored coat. As expected, transcriptional silencing correlated with hypermethylation at A(vy). This demonstrates, for the first time, that ethanol can affect adult phenotype by altering the epigenotype of the early embryo. Interestingly, we also detected postnatal growth restriction and craniofacial dysmorphology reminiscent of fetal alcohol syndrome, in congenic a/a siblings of the A(vy) mice. These findings suggest that moderate ethanol exposure in utero is capable of inducing changes in the expression of genes other than A(vy), a conclusion supported by our genome-wide analysis of gene expression in these mice. In addition, offspring of female mice given free access to 10\% (v/v) ethanol for four days per week for ten weeks prior to conception also showed increased transcriptional silencing of the A(vy) allele. Our work raises the possibility of a role for epigenetics in the etiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and it provides a mouse model that will be a useful resource in the continued efforts to understand the consequences of gestational alcohol exposure at the molecular level.},

abstract = {The use of nanoscale materials is growing exponentially, but there are also concerns about the environmental hazard to aquatic biota. Metal-containing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are an important group of these new materials, and are often made of one metal (e.g., Cu-NPs and Ag-NPs), metal oxides (e.g., ZnO and TiO(2) NPs), or composite of several metals. The physiological effects and toxicity of trace metals in the traditional dissolved form are relatively well known and the overall aim of this review was to use our existing conceptual framework of metal toxicity in fish to compare and contrast the effects of nanometals. Conceptually, there are some fundamental differences that relate to bioavailability and uptake. The chemistry and behaviour of nanometals involves dynamic aspects of aggregation theory, rather than the equilibrium models traditionally used for free metal ions. Some NPs, such as Cu-NPs, may also release free metal ions from the surface of the particle. Biological uptake of NPs is not likely via ion transporters, but endocytosis is a possible uptake mechanism. The body distribution, metabolism, and excretion of nanometals is poorly understood and hampered by a lack of methods for measuring NPs in tissues. Although data sets are still limited, emerging studies on the acute toxicity of nanometals have so far shown that these materials can be lethal to fish in the mg-$\mu$gl(-1) range, depending on the type of material. Evidence suggests that some nanometals can be more acutely toxic to some fish than dissolved forms. For example, juvenile zebrafish have a 48-h LC(50) of about 0.71 and 1.78mgl(-1) for nano- and dissolved forms of Cu respectively. The acute toxicity of metal NPs is not always explained, or only partly explained, by the presence of free metal ions; suggesting that other novel mechanisms may be involved in bioavailability. Evidence suggests that nanometals can cause a range of sublethal effects in fish including respiratory toxicity, disturbances to trace elements in tissues, inhibition of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase, and oxidative stress. Organ pathologies from nanometals can be found in a range of organs including the gill, liver, intestine, and brain. These sublethal effects suggest some common features in the sublethal responses to nanometals compared to metal salts. Effects on early life stages of fish are also emerging, with reports of nanometals crossing the chorion (e.g., Ag-NPs), and suggestions that the nano-forms of some metals (Cu-NPs and ZnO NPs) may be more toxic to embryos or juveniles, than the equivalent metal salt. It remains possible that nanometals could interfere with, and/or stimulate stress responses in fish; but data has yet to be collected on this aspect. We conclude that nanometals do have adverse physiological effects on fish, and the hazard for some metal NPs will be different to the traditional dissolved forms of metals.},

Specific existing industry practices are reviewed. Recent advances in stereological theory, software, hardware, and automated immunohistochemical staining now make it feasible to implement unbiased stereological methods to assess test article-related effects on cell number in a regulatory toxicology setting. These design-based stereological methods for counting cells are recommended when the quantification of small changes in cell number is critical to the risk assessment or decision-making process.

abstract = {Pesticides used in agriculture are designed to protect crops against unwanted species, such as weeds, insects, and fungus. Many compounds target the nervous system of insect pests. Because of the similarity in brain biochemistry, such pesticides may also be neurotoxic to humans. Concerns have been raised that the developing brain may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of neurotoxic pesticides. Current requirements for safety testing do not include developmental neurotoxicity. We therefore undertook a systematic evaluation of published evidence on neurotoxicity of pesticides in current use, with specific emphasis on risks during early development. Epidemiologic studies show associations with neurodevelopmental deficits, but mainly deal with mixed exposures to pesticides. Laboratory experimental studies using model compounds suggest that many pesticides currently used in Europe--including organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, ethylenebisdithiocarbamates, and chlorophenoxy herbicides--can cause neurodevelopmental toxicity. Adverse effects on brain development can be severe and irreversible. Prevention should therefore be a public health priority. The occurrence of residues in food and other types of human exposures should be prevented with regard to the pesticide groups that are known to be neurotoxic. For other substances, given their widespread use and the unique vulnerability of the developing brain, the general lack of data on developmental neurotoxicity calls for investment in targeted research. While awaiting more definite evidence, existing uncertainties should be considered in light of the need for precautionary action to protect brain development.},

Inbreeding-matings between closely related individuals-can have negative fitness consequences for natural populations, and there is evidence of inbreeding depression in many wildlife populations. In some cases, reduced fitness in inbred populations has been shown to be exacerbated under chemical stress. In chemical testing, both inbred and outbred laboratory animals are used and for human safety assessments, iso-genic strains (virtual clones) of mice and rats are often employed that reduce response variation, the number of animals used and associated costs. In contrast, for environmental risk assessment, strains of animals are often used that have been selectively bred to maintain heterozygosity, with the assumption that they are better able to predict adverse effects in wild, genetically variable, animals. This may not necessarily be the case however, as one outbred strain may not be representative of another or of a wild population. In this paper, we critically discuss relationships between genetic variation, inbreeding and chemical effects with the intention of seeking to support more effective chemical testing for the protection of wildlife.},

abstract = {We provide a demonstration in humans of the principle of pharmacometabonomics by showing a clear connection between an individual's metabolic phenotype, in the form of a predose urinary metabolite profile, and the metabolic fate of a standard dose of the widely used analgesic acetaminophen. Predose and postdose urinary metabolite profiles were determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. The predose spectra were statistically analyzed in relation to drug metabolite excretion to detect predose biomarkers of drug fate and a human-gut microbiome cometabolite predictor was identified. Thus, we found that individuals having high predose urinary levels of p-cresol sulfate had low postdose urinary ratios of acetaminophen sulfate to acetaminophen glucuronide. We conclude that, in individuals with high bacterially mediated p-cresol generation, competitive O-sulfonation of p-cresol reduces the effective systemic capacity to sulfonate acetaminophen. Given that acetaminophen is such a widely used and seemingly well-understood drug, this finding provides a clear demonstration of the immense potential and power of the pharmacometabonomic approach. However, we expect many other sulfonation reactions to be similarly affected by competition with p-cresol and our finding also has important implications for certain diseases as well as for the variable responses induced by many different drugs and xenobiotics. We propose that assessing the effects of microbiome activity should be an integral part of pharmaceutical development and of personalized health care. Furthermore, we envisage that gut bacterial populations might be deliberately manipulated to improve drug efficacy and to reduce adverse drug reactions.},

abstract = {This article outlines the changes and underlying rationale for modifications to the histopathological evaluation of the nervous system during toxicology and carcinogenesis studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP). In the past, routine evaluation of the nervous system was mostly limited to three sections of brain, and occasionally the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Factors such as the increasing occurrence of human neurological diseases and associated economical cost burden, the role of unidentified environmental stressors in neurodegenerative disorders, multiple therapeutic drug-induced neuropathies noted in human clinical trials, and the exponential use of environmental chemicals with unknown neurotoxic potential necessitate a more extensive evaluation of the nervous system. The NTP has modified its protocol to include examination of key anatomic subsites related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Modifications include four additional sections of the brain. Increasing the number of brain sections permits examination of a greater number of specific anatomic subsites with unique vulnerability. In addition, the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, trigeminal ganglion, and intestinal autonomic ganglia will be evaluated as needed. It is expected that this modified approach will increase the sensitivity of detecting neurotoxicants and neurocarcinogens important in human neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders.},

Frogs with extra limbs or digits, missing limbs or digits, or misaligned appendages raise an alarming question: "Are deformed humans next?" Taking a fresh look at this disturbing environmental problem, this reference provides a balanced overview of the science behind the malformed frog phenomenon. Bringing together data from ecology, parasitology, and other disciplines, Michael Lannoo considers the possible causes of these deformities, tells which frogs have been affected, and addresses questions about what these malformations might mean to human populations. Featuring high-quality radiographic images, Malformed Frogs suggests that our focus should be on finding practical solutions, a key component of which will be controlling chemical, nutrient, and pesticide runoff into wetlands.},

We examined whether embryonic exposure to maternally derived mercury (Hg) interacts with dietary exposure to negatively influence larval development in American toads ( Bufo americanus ). We collected eggs from breeding pairs at reference and Hg-contaminated sites and monitored performance, development, and survival of larvae fed three experimental Hg diets (total Hg, 0.01, 2.5, and 10 $\mu$g/g). The negative sublethal effects of maternal and/or dietary Hg manifested differently, but maternal Hg exposure had a greater overall influence on offspring health than dietary exposure. However, the combination of sublethal effects of the two exposure routes interacted with lethal consequences; larvae exposed to maternal Hg and high dietary Hg experienced 50\% greater mortality compared to larvae from reference mothers fed the control diet. This study is the first to demonstrate that the latent effects of maternally transferred contaminants may be exacerbated by further exposure later in ontogeny, findings that may have important implications for both wildlife and human health.},

abstract = {The Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) is a level of human intake or exposure that is considered to be of negligible risk, despite the absence of chemical-specific toxicity data. The TTC approach is a form of risk characterisation in which uncertainties arising from the use of data on other compounds are balanced against the low level of exposure. The approach was initially developed by the FDA for packaging migrants, and used a single threshold value of 1.5 microg/day (called the threshold of regulation). Subsequent analyses of chronic toxicity data resulted in the development of TTC values for three structural classes with different potentials for toxicity (1,800, 540 and 90 microg/day). These TTC values have been incorporated into the procedure that is used internationally for the evaluation of flavouring substances. Further developments included additional TTC values for certain structural alerts for genotoxicity (0.15 microg/day), and for the presence of an organophosphate group (18 microg/day). All of these TTC values were incorporated into an extended decision tree for chemicals, such as contaminants, which might be present in human foods. The TTC approach has been shown to have potential applications to risk assessments of cosmetic ingredients, household products and impurities in therapeutic drugs.},

abstract = {Relative potency plays an important role in toxicology. Estimates of relative potency are used to rank chemicals by their effects, to calculate equivalent doses of test chemicals compared to a standard, and to weight contributions of constituent chemicals when evaluating mixtures. Typically relative potency is characterized by a constant dilution factor, even when non-similar dose-response curves indicate that constancy is inappropriate. Improperly regarding relative potency as constant may distort conclusions and potentially mislead investigators or policymakers. We consider a more general approach that allows relative potency to vary as a function of dose, response, or response quantile. Distinct functions can be defined, each generalizing different but equivalent descriptions of constant relative potency. When two chemicals have identical response limits, these functions all carry fundamentally equivalent information; otherwise, relative potency as a function of response quantile is distinct and embodies a modified definition of relative potency. Which definition is preferable depends on whether one views any differences in response limits as intrinsic to the chemicals or as extrinsic, arising from idiosyncrasies of data sources. We illustrate these ideas with constructed examples and real data. Relative potency functions offer a unified and principled description of relative potency for non-similar dose-response curves.},

Applying the term 'tool' to biological systems used in disease-related studies will help to identify those systems that can most effectively address mechanisms underlying human disease.

It is strongly supported by observations of leukemias that bear specific chromosome translocations, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, in which a translocation activates the c-myc gene, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which the Philadelphia chromosome causes production of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Although the SMT has been modified and extended to encompass tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic inheritance, and tumor progression through accumulation of further mutations, perhaps the strongest validation comes from the successful treatment of certain malignancies with drugs that directly target the product of the mutant gene.

To model these human exposures, we examined mitochondrial integrity at birth and 1 year in brain cortex and liver from offspring of retroviral-free Erythrocebus patas dams-administered human-equivalent NRTI doses for the last half (10 weeks) of gestation. Additional infants, followed for 1 year, were given the same drugs as their mothers for the first 6 weeks of life. Exposures included: no drug, Zidovudine (AZT), Lamivudine (3TC), AZT/3TC, AZT/Didanosine (ddI), and Stavudine (d4T)/3TC. In brain and liver, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme activities (complexes I, II, and IV) showed minimal differences between unexposed and NRTI-exposed offspring at both times. Brain and liver mitochondria from most NRTI-exposed patas, both at birth and 1 year of age, contained significant (p < 0.05) morphological damage observed by electron microscopy (EM), based on scoring of coded photomicrographs. Brain and liver mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in NRTI-exposed patas were depleted significantly in the 3TC and d4T/3TC groups at birth and were depleted significantly (p < 0.05) at 1 year in all NRTI-exposed groups. In 1-year-old infants exposed in utero to NRTIs, mtDNA depletion was 28.8-51.8\% in brain and 37.4-56.5\% in liver. These investigations suggest that some NRTI-exposed human infants may sustain similar mitochondrial compromise in brain and liver and should be followed long term for cognitive integrity and liver function.},

abstract = {Males and females of virtually all species differ in how they respond to their environment. Because such differences exist in almost all biological realms, including disease patterns and therapeutic outcomes, they have evoked calls by various bodies to incorporate their assessment in research. Neurobehavioral indices pose special questions because, unlike outwardly visible markers, they are described by complex functional outcomes or subtle alterations in brain structure. These divergent responses arise because they are inscribed in the genome itself and then by endocrine mechanisms that govern sexual differentiation of the brain during development and operate throughout life. Other organ systems that exhibit sex differences include the liver, an important consideration for neurotoxicology because it may process many toxic chemicals differentially in males and females. Despite the scope and pervasiveness of sex differences, however, they are disregarded by much of neurotoxicology research. Males predominate in behavioral experiments, few such experiments study both sexes, some investigators fail to even describe the sex of their subjects, and in vitro studies tend to wholly ignore sex, even for model systems aimed at neurological disorders that display marked sex differences. The public is acutely aware of sex differences in behavior, as attested by its appetite for books on the topic. It closely follows debates about the proportion of women in professions that feature science and mathematics. Neurotoxicology, especially in the domain of laboratory research, will be hindered in its ability to translate its findings into human health measures if it assigns sex differences to a minor role. It must also be sensitive to how such debates are framed. Often, the differences evoking the most discussion are subtle in scope. They do not lend themselves to the typical analyses conducted by experimenters; that is, reliance on mean differences and null hypothesis testing.},

abstract = {There has been a growing concern that epigenetic events, that is, heritable changes in gene expression superimposed on DNA nucleotide sequences, may be involved in chemically and/or nutritionally mediated adverse health outcomes, such as reproductive toxicity and cancer. This concern has been driven by an increasing number of studies reporting toxicant-induced alterations to the epigenome in the form of changes in DNA methylation, histone/chromatin remodeling, and altered expression of non-coding RNAs. These three major mechanisms of epigenetic modifications may have coordinated, independent, or potentially antagonistic influences on gene expression. Complicating this understanding is the incomplete understanding of the normal state and dynamic variation of the epigenome, which differs widely between cells, tissues, developmental state, age, strain, and species. This review serves as a framework to outline characteristics composing an ideal epigenetic screen(s) for hazard identification in product safety assessment. In order to implement such a screen, first there needs to be a better understanding of adaptive versus adverse changes in the epigenome, which includes identification of robust and reproducible causal links between epigenetic changes and adverse apical end points, and second development of improved reporter assay tools to monitor such changes. An ideal screen would be in vitro-based, medium- to high-throughput, and assess all three branches of epigenome control (i.e. methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs), although also being quantitative, objective, portable (i.e. lab to lab), and relevant to humans.},

abstract = {Scientists and clinicians who study genetic alterations and disease have traditionally described phenotypes in natural language. The considerable variation in these free-text descriptions has posed a hindrance to the important task of identifying candidate genes and models for human diseases and indicates the need for a computationally tractable method to mine data resources for mutant phenotypes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ontological annotation of disease phenotypes will facilitate the discovery of new genotype-phenotype relationships within and across species. To describe phenotypes using ontologies, we used an Entity-Quality (EQ) methodology, wherein the affected entity (E) and how it is affected (Q) are recorded using terms from a variety of ontologies. Using this EQ method, we annotated the phenotypes of 11 gene-linked human diseases described in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). These human annotations were loaded into our Ontology-Based Database (OBD) along with other ontology-based phenotype descriptions of mutants from various model organism databases. Phenotypes recorded with this EQ method can be computationally compared based on the hierarchy of terms in the ontologies and the frequency of annotation. We utilized four similarity metrics to compare phenotypes and developed an ontology of homologous and analogous anatomical structures to compare phenotypes between species. Using these tools, we demonstrate that we can identify, through the similarity of the recorded phenotypes, other alleles of the same gene, other members of a signaling pathway, and orthologous genes and pathway members across species. We conclude that EQ-based annotation of phenotypes, in conjunction with a cross-species ontology, and a variety of similarity metrics can identify biologically meaningful similarities between genes by comparing phenotypes alone. This annotation and search method provides a novel and efficient means to identify gene candidates and animal models of human disease, which may shorten the lengthy path to identification and understanding of the genetic basis of human disease.},

abstract = {Toxicoproteomic samples are rich in posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. Identifying these modifications via standard database searching can incur significant performance penalties. Here, we describe the latest developments in TagRecon, an algorithm that leverages inferred sequence tags to identify modified peptides in toxicoproteomic data sets. TagRecon identifies known modifications more effectively than the MyriMatch database search engine. TagRecon outperformed state of the art software in recognizing unanticipated modifications from LTQ, Orbitrap, and QTOF data sets. We developed user-friendly software for detecting persistent mass shifts from samples. We follow a three-step strategy for detecting unanticipated PTMs in samples. First, we identify the proteins present in the sample with a standard database search. Next, identified proteins are interrogated for unexpected PTMs with a sequence tag-based search. Finally, additional evidence is gathered for the detected mass shifts with a refinement search. Application of this technology on toxicoproteomic data sets revealed unintended cross-reactions between proteins and sample processing reagents. Twenty-five proteins in rat liver showed signs of oxidative stress when exposed to potentially toxic drugs. These results demonstrate the value of mining toxicoproteomic data sets for modifications.},

@article{LaDou2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: All forms of asbestos are now banned in 52 countries. Safer products have replaced many materials that once were made with it. Nonetheless, many countries still use, import, and export asbestos and asbestos-containing products, and in those that have banned other forms of asbestos, the so-called "controlled use" of chrysotile asbestos is often exempted from the ban. In fact, chrysotile has accounted for > 95\% of all the asbestos used globally. OBJECTIVE: We examined and evaluated the literature used to support the exemption of chrysotile asbestos from the ban and how its exemption reflects the political and economic influence of the asbestos mining and manufacturing industry. DISCUSSION: All forms of asbestos, including chrysotile, are proven human carcinogens. All forms cause malignant mesothelioma and lung and laryngeal cancers, and may cause ovarian, gastrointestinal, and other cancers. No exposure to asbestos is without risk. Illnesses and deaths from asbestos exposure are entirely preventable. CONCLUSIONS: All countries of the world have an obligation to their citizens to join in the international endeavor to ban the mining, manufacture, and use of all forms of asbestos. An international ban is urgently needed. There is no medical or scientific basis to exempt chrysotile from the worldwide ban of asbestos.},

@article{Guerrero-Bosagna2010,
abstract = {Previous observations have demonstrated that embryonic exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin during gonadal sex determination promotes transgenerational adult onset disease such as male infertility, kidney disease, prostate disease, immune abnormalities and tumor development. The current study investigates genome-wide promoter DNA methylation alterations in the sperm of F3 generation rats whose F0 generation mother was exposed to vinclozolin. A methylated DNA immunoprecipitation with methyl-cytosine antibody followed by a promoter tilling microarray (MeDIP-Chip) procedure was used to identify 52 different regions with statistically significant altered methylation in the sperm promoter epigenome. Mass spectrometry bisulfite analysis was used to map the CpG DNA methylation and 16 differential DNA methylation regions were confirmed, while the remainder could not be analyzed due to bisulfite technical limitations. Analysis of these validated regions identified a consensus DNA sequence (motif) that associated with 75\% of the promoters. Interestingly, only 16.8\% of a random set of 125 promoters contained this motif. One candidate promoter (Fam111a) was found to be due to a copy number variation (CNV) and not a methylation change, suggesting initial alterations in the germline epigenome may promote genetic abnormalities such as induced CNV in later generations. This study identifies differential DNA methylation sites in promoter regions three generations after the initial exposure and identifies common genome features present in these regions. In addition to primary epimutations, a potential indirect genetic abnormality was identified, and both are postulated to be involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance observed. This study confirms that an environmental agent has the ability to induce epigenetic transgenerational changes in the sperm epigenome.},

@article{Colbourne2011,
abstract = {We describe the draft genome of the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex, which is only 200 megabases and contains at least 30,907 genes. The high gene count is a consequence of an elevated rate of gene duplication resulting in tandem gene clusters. More than a third of Daphnia’s genes have no detectable homologs in any other available proteome, and the most amplified gene families are specific to the Daphnia lineage. The coexpansion of gene families interacting within metabolic pathways suggests that the maintenance of duplicated genes is not random, and the analysis of gene expression under different environmental conditions reveals that numerous paralogs acquire divergent expression patterns soon after duplication. Daphnia-specific genes, including many additional loci within sequenced regions that are otherwise devoid of annotations, are the most responsive genes to ecological challenges.},

\begin{abstract}
Lignin is considered the most recalcitrant component of plant litter, accumulated during early decomposition and degraded only during late decomposition stages when its concentration limits litter decomposition rates. A recent study based on the more specific (CuO-oxidation) to determine lignin contents reports challenges this concept, reporting highest lignin decomposition rates during early litter decomposition. Until now, no further studies exploring early lignin decomposition were published, and its potential controls remain unknown.

We follow early litter decomposition with analytical pyrolysis in a climate-chamber decomposition experiment, focusing on resource control over early lignin decomposition and microbial carbon substrate preferences. Beech litter with different C:N:P stoichiometry but innoculated with identical initial microbial communities was incubated at constant climatic conditions to identify the control of litter chemistry on the developing microbial community and its decomposition activity. We use analytical pyrolysis to quantify lignin and carbohydrate break-down.

During the first 6 month fundamental differences in lignin degrading activities were found between sites. Lignin discrimination in litter decomposition ranges between only marginal amounts of lignin being decomposed and lignin decomposition at the same rate average litter, leading to different niveaus of lignin accumulation. Between 6 and 15 month, no lignin discrimination was found, but different lignin contents aquired earlier reminded.

Neither nitrogen nor labile carbon availability could be identified as a control over lignin decomposition. However, amounts of lignin decomposed were correlated to the buildup of resource to decomposer C:N and C:P imbalances.

\section{Introduction}
Plant litter biomass is dominated by macromolecular compounds. Together, lignin, carbohydrate and protein polymers make up xx\% of litter dry mass, while leach-able substances in litter account for only xx \%. %The conversion of insoluble compounds in particular organic matter (``POM'') into soluble substances is key process in litter decomposition: Microorganisms can only metabolize DOM directly, but rely on the excretion of extracellular enzymes to convert POM in DOM \citep{Klotzbucher2011,Bengtson2007,Marschner2003}.

%Carbohydrates and protein (de)polymerization is based on (de)hydrolyzation, enzymatically catalyzed and results in clearly defined polymer structures. In contrast, lignin is result of a radical polymerization reaction of enzyme-activated monomers. During lignin condensation other compounds - most prominently carbohydrates and protein - are incorporated into lignin structures and shielded from decomposing enzymes \citep{Achyuthan2010}. Extracted (ADF) lignin fractions from fresh beech litter were found to have nitrogen contents twice as high as bulk litter \citep{Dyckmans2002}.

Litter decomposition models [lit] follow the concept that macromolecules in litter form three independent carbon pools of increasing recalcitrance attributed to (1) soluble compounds, (2) cellulose and hemi-celluloses and (3) lignin. During decomposition, soluble compounds are most accessible to microbes and consumed first, followed by carbohydrates (i.e. cellulose). Lignin can be decomposed only by specialists and is not degraded until accumulated to a certain, critical level when it inhibits the degradation of less recalcitrant compounds \citep{Berg1980, Couteaux1995, Moorhead2006}.\footnote{more lit.} Most common methods to quantify these carbon pools gravimatrically determine cellulose, hemi-celluloses and lignin contents after sequential extractions with selective solvents. These methods (``Klason''- and ``ADF''-lignin) were repeatedly criticize as unspecific for lignin determination \citep{i.e. Hatfield2005}. When analyzed with alternative methods (NMR, CuO-oxidation, Pyrolysis-GC/MS), extracted lignin fractions contain many other than the proclaimed substances. (i.e. \cite{Preston1997} \footnote{[lit CuO], lit[Pyr]}. %However, while not helpful in tracking the fate of lignin in litter decomposition, these fractions - re-labeled ``acid un-hydrolyzable residues'' (AUR) - can be used as an indicator for the content of the most recalcitrant carbon compounds in litter \citep{Prescott2010}. For the lipids and plant waxes also found in AUR fraction, neither their accumulation/depletion during decomposition nor the effect of their concentration on decomposition processes is known \footnote{!check!,!lit!}

Experiments using isotope labeling used to calculate mean residence times for lignin in soils and litter/soil mixtures in both laboratory and outdoor incubation reported lignin residence times no longer than that of other carbon compounds or bulk SOM \citep{Thevenot2010a, Bol2009}\footnote{more lit?}.

Based on their results, the authors proposed a new concept for lignin degradation in which fastest lignin degradation occurs during early litter decomposition. Lignin decomposition during late decomposition is limited by (dissolved organic) carbon availability, a pulsed input of labile carbon (during litterfall or experimental manipulations like drying and rewetting) causes higher lignin degradation rates for a limited time period .

Nitrogen fertilization experiments on litter and soils indicate a that litter N contents are important controls of lignin degradation: N addition increases mass loss rates in low-lignin litter while slowing down decomposition in lignin-rich litter \citep{Knorr2005}. High nitrogen levels were reported to inhibit lignolytic enzyme in forest soils\citep{Sinsabaugh2010}. Cellulose triggered higher priming effect in fertilized than in unfertilized soils indicating that the mineralization of recalcitrant C is controlled by an interaction of labile C and N availability \citep{Fontaine2011}.

To our knowledge, no other experiment has yet compared effects of intra-specific variance in litter nutrient contents on decomposition processes. N-fertilization experiments can simulate increased N-deposition rates. To simulate variations litter C:N ratios, our approach is preferable, because potential variations in litter N content occur in complex substrates. N location and accessibility is different from the low molecular weight N species used in fertilization experiments.

Therefore it is important to assess the impact of shifts in litter C:N ratio on decomposition processes and the chemical nature of the resulting organic matter to predict feedback mechanisms of anthropogenic alterations of global carbon and nitrogen cycles. While predictions of changes in mass loss rates under alternated litter C:N ratios are abound [lit.], no studies on changes in the quality of litter biomass during and after decomposition or of the dynamics of accumulation/depletion of fragments of the litter biomass during decomposition exist yet.]

Lignified cellulose and protein is not accessable without degrading lignin... Ligin fractions extracted from (fresh) beech litter have beed demonstrated to have a very narrow C:N ratio if compared to bulk litter, nonligneous cell walls or soluble matter. It is assumed, that proteins are covalently bound to lignin polymers during polymerization. For litter decomposing microbia this implies that degrading lignin increases nitrogen availability, while degrading non-lignified carbohydrates yields more metabolic energy, but no additional nitrogen.

More lignin is decomposed when nitrogen availability is low, and high nitrogen availability inhibits lignin degradation.

Briefly, beech litter was collected at four different sites in Austria (Achenkirch (AK), Klausenleopoldsdorf(KL), Ossiach(OS), and Schottenwald(SW); refered to as litter types) in October 2008. Litter was cut to pieces of approximately 0.25cm$^2$, homogenized, sterilized twice by gamma\footnote{greek gamma here} radiation (35 kGy, 7 days between irradiations) and inoculated (1.5\% w/w) with a mixture of litter and soil to assure that all litter types share the same initial microbial community. From each type, four samples of litter were taken after inoculation and stored dried at room temperature. Samples of 60g litter (fresh weight) were incubated at 15 \textdegree C and 60\% water content in mesocosms for a duration between 2 weeks to 15 month. For each litter type 5 replicas were removed and analyzed after 14, 97, 181 and 475 days.

C:N ratios between 1:41 and 1:58 and C:P ratios between 1:700 and 1:1300 were found, N:P ratios ranged between 1:15 and 1:30. No significant changes occurred during litter incubation except a slight decrease of the C:N ratio (1:41.8 to 1:37.4) found in the most active litter type (SW) after 15 month. Fe content were more than twice as high for OS (approx. 450 ppm) than for other litter types (approx. 200 ppm). Litter Mn also was highly variable between litter types, ranging between 170 and 2130 ppm. Changes of micro-nutrient concentrations during litter incubation were significant, but in all cases \textless 15\% of the initial concentration.

Dried litter was ball-milled for further chemical analysis. Litter C and N content were determined using an elemental analyzer (Leco CN2000, Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA). Litter phosphorus content was measured with ICP-AES (Vista-Pro, Varian, Darmstadt, Germany) after acid digestion \cite{Henschler1988}).

Samples were shaken on a reciprocal shaker with the extractant for 30 minutes, filtered with ash-free filters and frozen at -20 \textdegree C until analysis. To quantify microbial biomass C, N and P pools, sample were extracted under the same conditions after chloroform fumigation. Microbial biomass was determined as the difference between fumigated and non-fumigated extractions \citep{Schinner1996}.

Activities were determined with a series of micro-plate assays based on the hydrolysis of 4-methyl-$\beta$-D-cellobioside (cellulase) and L-3,4-di\-hydroxy\-phenyl\-alanin (oxidative enzymes). Products of enzyme catalyzed reactions were detected photometrically (oxidative enzymes) or flourometrically (cellulase) \citep{Marx2001, Sinsabaugh1999, Kaiser2010b}.

GC oven temperature was constant at 50 \textdegree C for 2 minutes, followed by an increase of 7\textdegree C/min to a final temperature of 260 \textdegree C, which was held for 15 minutes. The MS detector was set for electron ionization at 70 EV cycling between m/z 20 and 300.\footnote{maybe cite other paper for method?}

For each peak between one and four dominant mass fragments selected for high abundance and specificity were integrated and converted to TIC peak areas by a multiplication with a MS response coefficient \citep{Schellekens2009, Kuder1998}. For principal component analysis, unconverted areas were used. Peak areas are stated as \% of the sum of all integrated peaks of a sample.

If not mentioned otherwise, results were considered significant when p \textless  0.05. Due to the frequent of variance inhomogenities Welch anova and paired Welch's t-tests with Bonferroni corrected p limits were used. Principal component analysis was performed using vegan function ``rda'' scaling variables. All correlations refer to Pearson correlations. We calculated correlations between depletion and degradation rates found in this study with litter chemistry parametres and process data reported by \cite{Mooshammer2011} and \cite{Leitner2011}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Mass loss, respiration and extractable organic carbon}

Litter mass loss was not significant after 2 weeks and 3 month, significant for 2 litter types after 6 month. After 15 month, litter mass loss was significant for all litter types, and strongly correlated to litter N content (R=0.794, p=***). Detailed results were reported by \citep{Mooshammer2011}. After 15 month, between 5 and 12\% of the initial dry mass was lost. This is less than reported in litter decomposition studies on other species, but in a similar range as recently reported for beech litter from an in-situ litterbag-study \citep{Kalbitz2006} .

Highest respiration rates were measured after 14 days incubation (150-350 \textmu g CO\textsubscript{2}-C d-1 g-1 litter-C), dropped to rates between between 75 and 100 \textmu g CO\textsubscript{2}-C d-1 g-1 litter-C after 97 days. After 181 and 375 days, respiration rates for AK and OS further decreased, while SW and KL show a second maximal respiration after 181 days. %Respiration was correlated to litter N content after 2 weeks, 6 and 15 month(R\textgreater 0.70 in all cases, all p \textless  0.001), but not after 3 month. All harvests combined were weakly correlated to litter N content (R=0.416, p \textless  0.001).
%Accumulated respiration was correlated to litter mass loss for all harvest with significant mass loss when means per litter type and harvest were compared (n=6).

Soluble organic carbon content decreased between the first three harvests (14 to 181 days), to strongly increase after 475 days (fig. \ref. 0.1 to 0.7 mg C g$^{-1}$ d.w. were found after 14, 97 and 181 days, and increased to amounts between 1.5 and 4 mg/g after 375 days. After 14 and 97 days, the highest C content was found in SW litter followed by AK (see fig. \ref{fig:doc}. DOC content was loosely correlated to litter N content after 14 (R=0.69, p\textless  0.001) and 97 days (R = 0.65, p =\textless  0.01), they were strictly correlated after 181 days (R = 0.85, p=\textless  0.001) and 375 days (R=0.90, p=\textless  0.001).

\subsection{Microbial Community}



\subsubsection{Microbial biomass abundance and stoichiometry}

Microbial biomass contents ranged from 0.5 to 6 mg C, 0.05 to 5.5mg N and 0.05 to 3.5 mg P per g litter (d.w.). In KL and OS biomass buildup reaches a plateau after 3 month, AK and SW show further growth reaching a maximum of microbial C and N contents after 6 month (AK also for P). Microbial C:N ratios measured range between 1:6 and 1:18, C:P ratios between 1:8 abd 1:35, and N:P ratios between 1:0.5 and 1:3.5. Microbial C:N ratios (Fig. \ref{fig:mb}).

Litter microbial biomass is homeostatic during the first 6 month (no or marginally negative correlation between microbial stoichiometry and litter stoichiometry) \citep{Mooshammer2011}, but not after 15 month, when all three ratios show correlations (R 0.53 - 0.64, p < 0.016). Litter C:N ratios are tighly constrained after 3 (1:14.5 - 1:18.2) and 6 month (1:6.9 - 1:9.0), but significantly different between the two time points. C:P and N:P ratios are less constrained, with the highest variance between litter from different sites after 3 month incubation (Fig. \ref{fig:mb}).

\subsubsection{Potential enzyme activities}
Absolute potential enzyme activities were correlated to litter N, respiration and other other decomposition processes (all R \textgreater  0.8, p \textless 0.001). For all enzymes and at all time points, SW showed the highest and AK the lowest activity. Cellulase was below detecten limit after 14 days, oxidatitve enzymes after 15 month. Cellulases activity is highest after 3 month and decreases between 97 and 181 days. Peroxidase and Peroxidase activities reach their maximum after 181 (fig. \ref{fig:enz}). After between 6 and 15 month, cellulase activity strongly increased. After 475 days, the activity of oxidative enzymes was below the detection limit [data not shown]

The ratio between the potential activities of cellulases and oxidative enzymes was lowest for AK at all time points. Microbial communities in AK litter invest more energy and nitrogen into degrading lignin and less into degrading carbohydrates than other litter types. (fig. \ref{fig:enz})

\subsection{Pyrolysis-GC/MS and Lignin content}
\subsection{Changes in litter chemistry}
%Lignin contents determined by ADF extraction show initial lignin contents between 15 and 21 \% d.w.. After 3 month, lignin contents rise to levels above 30\% d.w. in two sites, an increase that can not be explained by passive accumulation \cite{Leitner2011}.

Litter pyrolysis products and different sites are reported in detail elsewhere (Kohl, in preparation). We found only minor changes during pyrograms during decomposition, differences between sites were were small but well preserved during decomposition. The high similarity allowed tracind small changes in lignin and carbohydrate abundance during decomposition. % A PCA performed on relative peak areas of 128 peaks shows that samples cluster according to litter types, with no constistent seperation between different harvests. \ref{fig:pca1}. %118 (94.5\%) [!check nr!] of the peaks integrated show significant differences in relative peak areas between different litter types before incubation.

When measured by pyr-GC/MS, lignin derrived compounds make up between 29 and 31 \%TIC in the initial litter, with an increase of up to 3 \%TIC over the first 3 month. Carbohydrate derrived pyrolysis products account for 26 to 29 \%TIC in initial litter and decrease by up to 2.6 \% during litter decomposition. Carbohydrate depletion and lignin accumulation were coorelated (R = 0.47, p \textless 0.01) in all samples measured. The initial (pyrolysis-) LCI index (applied to excludes influences of changes in the abundance of other pyrolysis products) ranges between 0.517 and 0.533. During decomposition, it increases by up to 8.7\% of the initial value, with SW showing the highest and KL the lowest increase. This increase almost completely occurs over the first 6 month, with insignificant changes in both directions between 6 and 15 month incubation. Figure \ref{fig:timeseries}\footnote{check fig.} shows changes in the relative abundance of in pyrolysis products versus incubation time and accumulated respiration. Lignin to carbohydrate ratios in a similar range (increasing from 0.565 to 0.588 over 24 month) were reported for in situ oak litter decomposition by \cite{Snajdr2010} using thermochemolysis. \footnote{I converted the L:C ratio stated by Snajdr to L/(L+C). This demonstrates a surprising coherence between quite different analytical methods, different peaks analyzed.}

 % Some details are worth mentioning here: Within the carbohydrates group, AK and OS have significantly higher peak areas for most (10 of 15) furan-type carbohydrate pyrolysis products, SW and KL are significantly higher in 2, rest show no clear pattern. Cyclopentenone-type carbohydrate pyrolysis products do not show this pattern.

 % Among the lignin derived pyrolysis products, while most other peaks are tightly correlated to each other, the ratio between methylguaiacol and guaiacol shows strong differences between AK and OS (0.7:1) vs. KL and SW (0.45:1). Similar differences can be found in the Methylsyringol:syringol ratio. These differences remain constant during litter incubation. Unlike other studies [lit.], we do not find a shift in the guaiacol/syringol ratio during decomposition.

To check wether the sum of lignin and carbohydrate peaks represents trends of the majority of derrived from these substances, for each peak in each sample, we substracted the mean relative peak area of the respective peak in initial litter of the same litter type and applied a principal component analysis to the results. (fig. \ref{fig:pca2}). The first two principal components represent 45.2\% of the total variance. Initial litter samples cluster cluster in the bottom right corner of the graph with positive loadings on PCA 1 and negative loadings on PCA2. Decomposed samples are shifted versus fresh litter along different axis: While decomposed SW samples are in the bottom left quadrant of the samples, shifted along PCA 1 toward more negative values and indifferent along PCA2, decomposed AK samples are shifted along PCA2 towards more positive values and do not shift along PCA1. KL and OS show intermediate decomposition trends. Their decomposed samples are placed in the top left corner, combining both decomposition trends.

Pyrolysis products that are positioned in the bottom-right quadrant are depleted in all litter types, while products in the top left quadrant are accumulated in all litter types. Substances in the bottom left quadrant are depleted in AK and accumulated in SW, substances in the top-right quadrant show the opposite trend.

21 of 28 lignin markers cluster with the most negative loadings on both PCA1 and PCA2. The trends described herein therefore are based on on a consistent set of independently quantified lignin  markers (fig.\ref{fig:pca2}. Carbohydrate products show diverging trends, with both accumulated and depleted compounds, representing the polymorphy of this compounds class in plant litter.

\subsubsection{Amounts of Lignin and Carbohydrates degraded}

During the first 6 month of litter decomposition, between one and 6\% of the initial lignin pool and between 4 and 17\% of the initial carbohydrate pool were degraded. Lignin decomposition was highest in AK and KL litter, while KL and SW decomposed the highest part of their carbohydrate pools. Lignin discimination (compared to carbohydrates) was highest in SW and lowest in AK litter. In AK litter, lignin molecules were 50\% more likely to be decomposed than carbohydrates, while in SW litter carbohydrates were 10 times more likely to be decomposed (fig. \ref{fig:degr}).

Between 6 and 15 month, no further discrimination occurs, lignin and carbohydrate are degraded at the same rates and their content in pyrograms remains constant (fig. \ref{fig:chemdif}).

%\subsubsection{Other phenolic and lipophilic compounds}

%We quantified a number of other recalcitrant or lipophilic substances (fig. \ref{fig:notlignin}). Phenoles (most dominant phenol and 2/3-methylphenol) account for up to 9-15 \% TIC, increasing in their abundance over the first 3 month (stronger in AK and KL litter than in OS and SW). While lignin does produce phenole during pyrolysis, so do carbohydrates and protein. The increase during the first
%Alkanes and alkenes show a drastic increase (+80\%) during the first three month. This increase can not be explained by passive accumulation, but corresponds to the build-up of microbial biomass during early litter decomposition. It also corresponds to the increase of extracted lignin. It could also be explained by the demethoxylation of lignin compounds, but no sufficient decrease in lignin pyrolysis product abundance was not found.
%N-alkanes and n-alkanes also strongly increase in their abundance over the first 3 month. Compound identified as phytol and three fatty acids (14:0, 16:0 and 18:9) are depleted during litter decomposition and therefore decomposed faster than average litter biomass (fig \ref{fig:waxes}), and are decomposed faster in N-poor than in N-rich litter. \footnote{to include this data or not to include it...}

\subsection{Correlation between litter chemistry, lignin decomposition, other processes}

Table \ref{corrtable} provides linear regressions found between lignin and carbohydrate degradation, litter chemistry, microbial biomass and decomposition processes after 6 month incubation including data presented by \cite{Mooshammer2011} and \cite{Leitner2011}. We found  The lignin to cellulose degradation ratio was correlated to phenoloxidase to cellulase and peroxidase to cellulase enzymatic activity ratios (R=0.729 and R=0.863, p=?). Lignin accumulation and carbohydrate depletion were found to increase with enzymatic activities measured (including lignolytic enzymes) N, and P gross depolymerization rates but not with glucan depolymerization.

While carbohydrate degradation and depletion was correlated litter N content, C:N ratio and C:N imbalances. lignin degradation and accumulation were correlated to litter P, litter C:P and N:P ratios, C:P and N:P imbalances and extractable organic C and PO$_4$. High lignin accumulation and carbohydrate depletion were also connected to wide C:N, C:P and N:P ratios.

Correlations litter Mn, Zn and Mg contents, lignin and carbohydrate decomposition found can be explained by intercorrelations of these elements with litter N and P contents.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Early lignin decomposition}
Our results demonstrates the relevance of lignin degradation during the the first 6 month of beech litter decomposition. Lignin decomposition rates depend on litter quality and vary between only marginal amounts to bulk carbon mineralization rates during the first 6 month of incubation and uniformly reach average carbon decomposition rates between 6 an 15 month. Lignin discrimination in carbon mineralization ranges from no discrimination to lignin being 10 times less likely to be degraded. We can therefore confirm that early lignin decomposition rates are by far underestimated \citep{Klotzbucher2011} applying a complementary anlytical approach. Unliky their results, we found no significant decreases in lignin contents during early decomposition. Also, lignin degradation rates were constant or increased during decomposition.

%Increases in AUR observed during early decomposition did not result from lignin accumulation, but from other compounds co-isolated in this unspecific method. Absolute increases in AUR contents also were found by other studies (i.e. by \cite{Berg1980}), but were usually neglected. \footnote{an extensive review on this point in the numerous publications using ADF lignin determination  in litter decomposition experiments is out of the range of the current work.}

\subsection{Temporal changes in lignin decomposition}
During the first 6 month, lignin accumulation strongly varies between beech litter from different sites. As the original microbial community was destroyed and replaced with a commun innoculum for all sites, differences found result from differences in litter chemistry. Between 6 and 15 month lignin contents remained constant in all litter types, indicating that lignin is not degraded slower than other litter compounds, but differences in lignin contents aquired during the first 6 month remain.

The absolute amount of lignin and the ratio in which lignin and carbohydrates are degraded during the first 6 month was ranges from marginal amounts (SW: not significant different from 0) to lignin degraded at same rate as bulk litter. Between 6 and 15 month, lignin degradation rates reach bulk litter carbon mineralization rates in all litter types, differences in lignin contents that developed during the frist 6 month are preserved at least until 15 month of incubation.

\cite{Klotzbucher2011} suggests a change in decoposition dynamics after 100 to 200 days of incubation, after which lignin decomposition rates due to lack of labile carbon. They also report a correlation between respiration rates and extractable carbon after this change. We can confirm the correlation between extractable carbon and respiration after 181 days, see both processes adapt to litter N content. Our data agrees that respiration is limited by labile carbon availability, but the production of labile carbon itself seems controled by litter N content. As the process of degrading macromolecular is conducted by extracellular enzymes and is more N intensive that the mineralization of labile carbon, depolymerization is the point in the decomposition process, where a N limitation would be most likely to become effective.

\subsection{Resource controls on carbon chemistry}
Recent literature suggests the availability of labile carbon \citep{Klotzbucher2011} or redox-active micronutrients like Mn and Fe \footnote{Lit.!} or low N availability \citep{Craine2007} as key controls for (late) lignin degradation.

Mn and Fe are important co-factors of oxidative enzymes involved into lignin decomposition. Several authors suggest Mn availability limits lignin degradation and is rate limiting in late litter decomposition stages. Mn and Fe contents strongly vary between the different litter types used. An experiment studying aquatic decomposition of the same litter suggested Mn contents controll decomposition processes like enzyme activties. We can exclude micronutrient availability as a limiting factor for lignin decomposition in our experiment, because Mn and Fe contents are lowest in the litter with the highest lignin decomposition (AK, table \ref{initstoech}). Low contents of these Elements would explain inhibited, not enhance lignin decomposition.

Most decomposition processes (enzyme activities and depolymerization rates) were correlated to litter nitrogen content and C:N ratio. We find lignin decomposition rates is negatively correlated to these processes, but not to litter N contents. Also, no little lignin decomposition occurs OS litter, which has a N content just as low as AK litter. The correlation found between LCI change and litter N and C:N seems based on an enhanced carbohydrate degradation, but no inhibition in lignin decomposition.

Availability of extractable carbon was highest in AK and SW litter, two sites which have the highest and the lowest lignin decomposition trends. Therefore, extracable carbon can be excluded as a control over lignin decomposition.

Most interestingly, lignin degradation activities are tightly correlated to litter/microbe C:P imbalances. These imbalances are not exclusively based in litter chemistry, but are also controled by microbial comunity. C:P imbalance reaches a maximum after 3 month whil C:N imbalances have a maximum after 6 month. Lignin decomposition found (especially changes in LCI) correlate to C:N imbalance. This indicantes that either elevated N demand triggers lignin decomposition or lignin decomposition allows additional N to be incorporated into the microbial community. However, the correlation to C:P imbalances are stricter (R=0.83, p \textless 0.001) and C:P imbalances develop earlier (after 3 month).

High C:N and C:P imbalances indicate C surpluss. Following the hypothesis that lignin decomposition is carbon limited, the carbon surplus available to microorganism might be invested into lignin degradation.

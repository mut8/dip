abstract = {Chitin is an insoluble component in the shells of several molluscan species. It is thought to play important roles, in biomineralization and shell structure. To date, however, reports are scarce and sometimes contradictory, and suffer from methodological problems. Only in a single cephalopod species has the chitin been identified as beta-chitin. We present data on chitin occurrence in 22 species of shell-bearing Mollusca (Conchifera) and Polyplacophora, including the first evidence for scaphopods, based on pyrolysis gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Pyrolysis GC-MS detected chitin in every tested member of the Conchifera. IR spectroscopy before and after chitinase treatment revealed at least three distinct patterns of peak changes. The contents of the insoluble shell organics included not only chitin and proteins, but also insoluble polysaccharides, e.g., glucan. We conclude that chitin was present in the last common ancestor of the Conchifera and that its abundance in the shell matrix depends on the differentiation of the shell.},

abstract = {The links among the changes in litter chemistry, the activity of extracellular enzymes and the microbial community composition were observed in Quercus petraea litter. Three phases of decomposition could be distinguished. In the early 4-month stage, with high activities of $\beta$-glucosidase, $\beta$-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase, 16.4\% of litter was decomposed. Hemicelluloses were rapidly removed while cellulose and lignin degradation was slow. In months 4-12, with high endocellulase and endoxylanase activities, decomposition of cellulose prevailed and 31.8\% of litter mass was lost. After the third phase of decomposition until month 24 with high activity of ligninolytic enzymes, the litter mass loss reached 67.9\%. After 2 years of decay, cellulose decomposition was almost complete and most of the remaining polysaccharides were in the form of hemicelluloses. Fungi largely dominated over bacteria as leaf endophytes and also in the litter immediately before contact with soil, and this fungal dominance lasted until month 4. Bacterial biomass (measured as phospholipid fatty acid content) in litter increased with time but also changed qualitatively, showing an increasing number of Actinobacteria. This paper shows that the dynamics of decomposition of individual litter components changes with time in accordance with the changes in the microbial community composition and its production of extracellular enzymes.},

abstract = {A collection of tannins extracted from various plant species was subjected to thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The products obtained included 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes, derived from A rings of condensed tannins (CTs), and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, and derivatives as major products from the B ring. 1,2,4-Tri- and two tetramethoxybenzenes were also detected in most analyses. Correlation analyses revealed that they were derived from the B ring, with 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene being derived from a procyanidin (PC) B ring and 1,2,3,5-tetramethoxybenzene from a prodelphinidin (PD) ring. Tannins from species that contained both CT and hydrolyzable tannin (HT) produced mainly permethylated gallic acid moieties upon THM, and the products derived from CTs were less abundant. Most likely, the ester-bound HTs are more easily transmethylated than the cleavage and methylation of the C-C and C-O linked CTs. Statistical analyses of the THM products and 13C NMR data of the tannins showed good correlations between the B ring hydroxylation and the di- and trimethoxybenzenes observed. Using the ratio of the methyl esters of 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid only provided good correlations of the percent PC as well. Furthermore, the 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes may serve as good markers of tannins in plant, soil, sediment or other samples as analyzed by THM.},

@article{Buurman2009,
abstract = {Humic acids have been widely investigated by spectroscopic methods. especially NMR and FTIR, and they are known to show significant differences according to their origin. Low resolution methods such as NMR and FTIR. however cannot easily distinguish different input sources or establish relations between SOM chemistry and vegetation or land use in general. High resolution methods, such as analytical pyrolysis and pyrolysis combined with methylation do offer such possibilities. Therefore, HAs from five reference soils called the Eurosoils, including a Vertic Cambisol (E1, Italy), a Rendzina (E2, Greece), a Dystic Cambisol (E3, Great Britain), an Orthic Luvisol (E4, France) and an Orthic Podzol (E5, Germany), that were previously characterized a.o. by NMR, FTIR and ESR, were also analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) and subsequent analysis by GC/MS. The Orthic Podzol sample showed the largest aliphaticity, and the strongest degradation of aliphatics and lignin. The Dystric Cambisol featured the least decomposed HA, which was reflected by a large content of long-chain alkanes, and little lignin degradation. Both the Dystric Cambisol and the Orthic Luvisol HAs contained a significant amount of microbial organic matter. Polyaromatics, which indicate the presence of charred material, were most abundant in the Vertic Cambisol and the Podzol HAs and lowest in the Dystric Cambisol and the Rendzina HAs. THM was able to distinguish between the various vegetations/land uses. Although quantifications by NMR and py-GC/MS are essentially different, the general results largely coincided. NMR appears to underestimate aromaticity and overestimate aliphaticity, but a molecular mixing model yielded reasonable correlations between NMR and pyrolysis data. Classification by 'degradation state' based on py-GC/MS largely coincided with acidity determined by titration, but FTIR data did not coincide. Py-GC/MS, with its much larger resolution, is a better tool to distinguish effects of vegetation, microbial input, and degradation. HA's produce the same variety of compounds upon pyrolysis as total SOM extracts and are therefore chemically not more simple than SOM. HA chemistry, however can be understood in the light of land use history and SOM dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Radiocarbon (14C) dating of total soil organic matter (SOM) often yields results inconsistent with the stratigraphic sequence. The onerous chemical extractions for SOM fractions do not always produce satisfactory 14C dates. In an effort to develop an alternative method, the pyrolysis-combustion technique was investigated to partition SOM into pyrolysis volatile (Py-V) and pyrolysis residue (Py-R) fractions. The Py-V fractions obtained from a thick glacigenic loess succession in Illinois yielded 14C dates much younger but more reasonable than the counterpart Py-R fractions for the soil residence time. Carbon isotopic composition 13C) was heavier in the Py-V fractions, suggesting a greater abundance of carbohydrate- and protein-related constituents, and 13C was lighter in the Py-R fractions, suggesting more ligninand lipid-related constituents. The combination of 14C dates and 13C values indicates that the Py-V fractions are less biodegradation resistant and the Py-R fractions are more biodegradation resistant. The pyrolysis-combustion method provides a less cumbersome approach for 14C dating of SOM fractions. With further study, this method may become a useful tool for analyzing unlithified terrestrial sediments when macrofossils are absent.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key factor in ecosystem dynamics. A better understanding of the global relationship between environmental characteristics, ecosystems and SOM chemistry is vital in order to assess its specific influence on carbon cycles. This study compared the composition of extracted SOM in 18 topsoil samples taken under tundra, taiga, steppe, temperate forest and tropical forest using pyrolysis-GC/MS. Results indicate that SOM from cold climates (tundra, taiga) still resembles the composition of litter, evidenced by high quantities of levosugars and long alkanes relative to N-compounds and a clear odd-over-even dominance of the longer alkanes. Under temperate conditions, increased microbial degradation generally results in a more altered SOM chemistry. SOM formed under temperate coniferous forests shows an accumulation of aromatic and aliphatic moieties, probably induced by substrate limitations. Tropical SOM was characterized by an SOM composition rich in N-compounds and low in lignins, without any accumulation of recalcitrant fractions (i.e. aliphatic and aromatic compounds). Lignin composition moreover varies according to vegetation type. Results were validated against 13 new samples. The humic signature of topsoil organic matter formed under different biomes indicates a dominating effect of (i) SOM input composition related to vegetation, and (ii) SOM breakdown reflecting both climate and input quality. No evidence was found for a chemically stabilized SOM fraction under favorable decomposition conditions (temperate or warm climate with broadleaved vegetation). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

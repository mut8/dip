abstract = {As computation emerges as central to the scientific enterprise, new modalities are necessary to ensure scientific findings are reproducible. Without access to the underlying code and data, it is all but impossible to reproducible today’s published computational scientific results. As seen in recent widely reported events, such as Climategate and the clinical trials scandal at Duke University, a lack of transparency in computational research undermines public confidence in science as well as slowing scientific progress, engendering a credibility crisis. In order to communicate scientific discoveries and knowledge through the release of the associated code and data, scientists face issues of copyright. In this talk I address copyright as a barrier to reproducible research and present open licensing solutions for computational science. My efforts, labeled The Reproducible Research Standard, are designed to realign the communication of modern computational scientific research with longstanding scientific norms. With transparency in scientific research, a new era of access to computational science is at hand that does not confine understanding to specialists, but permits knowledge transfer not just between disciplines but to any interested person in the world with an internet connection.},

abstract = {With the analysis of complex, messy data sets, the statistics community has recently focused attention on "reproducible research," namely research that can be readily replicated by others. One standard that has been proposed is the availability of data sets and computer code. However, in some situations, raw data cannot be disseminated for reasons of confidentiality or because the data are so messy as to make dissemination impractical. For one such situation, we propose 2 steps for reproducible research: (i) presentation of a table of data and (ii) presentation of a formula to estimate key quantities from the table of data. We illustrate this strategy in the analysis of data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, which investigated the effect of the drug finasteride versus placebo on the period prevalence of prostate cancer. With such an important result at stake, a transparent analysis was important.},

@misc{Perez2011,
abstract = {As an active participant of both the scientific research and the open-source software development communities, I have observed that the latter often lives up better than the former to our ideals of scientific openness and reproducibility. I will explore the reasons behind this, and I will argue that these problems are particularly acute in computational domains where they should be in fact less prevalent. Open source software development uses public fora for most discussion and systems for sharing code and data that are, in practice, powerful provenance tracking systems. There is a strong culture of public disclosure, tracking and fixing of bugs, and development often includes exhaustive automatic validation systems, that are executed automatically whenever changes are made to the software and whose output is publicly available on the internet. This helps with early detection of problems, mitigates their reoccurrence, and ensures that the state and quality of the software is a known qunatity under a wide variety of situations (operating systems, inputs, parameter ranges, etc). Additionally, the very systems that are used for sharing the code track the authorship of contributions. All of this ensures that open collaboration does not dilute the merit or recognition of any individual developer, and allows for a meritocracy of contributors to develop while enabling highly effective collaboration. In sharp contrast we have incentives in computational research, strongly biased towards rapid publication of papers without any realistic requirement of validation, that lead to a completely different outcome. Publications in computationally-based research (applied to any specific discipline) often lack any realistic hope of being reproduced, as the code behind them is not available, or if it is it rarely has any automated validation, history tracking, bug database, etc. I will discuss how we can draw specific lessons from the open source community both in terms of technical approaches and of changing the structure of incentives, to make progress towards a more solid base for reproducible computational research.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT : CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, is an ontology for describing the nature of reference citations in scientific research articles and other scholarly works, both to other such publications and also to Web information resources, and for publishing these descriptions on the Semantic Web. Citation are described in terms of the factual and rhetorical relationships between citing publication and cited publication, the in-text and global citation frequencies of each cited work, and the nature of the cited work itself, including its publication and peer review status. This paper describes CiTO and illustrates its usefulness both for the annotation of bibliographic reference lists and for the visualization of citation networks. The latest version of CiTO, which this paper describes, is CiTO Version 1.6, published on 19 March 2010. CiTO is written in the Web Ontology Language OWL, uses the namespace http://purl.org/net/cito/, and is available from http://purl.org/net/cito/. This site uses content negotiation to deliver to the user an OWLDoc Web version of the ontology if accessed via a Web browser, or the OWL ontology itself if accessed from an ontology management tool such as Prot\'{e}g\'{e} 4 (http://protege.stanford.edu/). Collaborative work is currently under way to harmonize CiTO with other ontologies describing bibliographies and the rhetorical structure of scientific discourse.},

Spatial cyberinfrastructures will have a higher chance of success if users of many types, including nonprofessionals, are made central to the development process. Recent studies in the history of infrastructures reveal key turning points and issues that should be considered in the development of spatial cyberinfrastructure projects. These studies highlight the importance of adopting qualitative research methods to learn how users work with data and digital tools, and how user communities form. The author's empirical research on data sharing networks in the Pacific Northwest salmon crisis at the turn of the 21st century demonstrates that ordinary citizens can contribute critical local knowledge to global databases and should be considered in the design and construction of spatial cyberinfrastructures.},

@book{Owens2010,
abstract = {In December 2009, after years of planning, preparations and extensive infrastructure deployment, the world's first regional-scale underwater ocean observatory was open for business. NEPTUNE Canada opened its instrument network and data archive to free and open access by anyone willing to register for an account. Thus, we have embarked on a journey to transform our observatory into an online platform for collaborative, multidisciplinary e-science. Four main areas of Internet-mediated activity characterize e-science: data provision, analysis \& visualization, collaboration and publication. Data provision entails making our large and ever expanding data archive accessible and searchable through the Web. To support online analysis \& visualization, tools must be developed, which allow scientists to display and manipulate a wide variety of data products derived from measurements gathered by the various instruments attached to the observatory. Virtual collaboration can be fostered by making it easy for groups of geographically or institutionally separated researchers to design experiments, control instruments, share analyses and discuss conclusions within a shared web-based workspace. Publication and dissemination of research findings can be supported by tools that help researchers manage and contribute to both informal outreach (e.g. blogs) and the iterative review and revision cycles required for formal manuscript authoring. E-science promises some tantalizing advantages over traditional approaches. By providing through-the-web access to a large multivariate data archive, researchers are freed from the burdens of data storage and management. Additionally, the archive can simultaneously serve multiple users at multiple institutions in widely separated locations. Community-driven development of analysis routines allows users to visualize the data using both existing and custom-created code. E-science also encourages higher levels of collaboration, allowing resear- - chers to form virtual teams able to tackle complex problems, where expertise in a variety of disciplines is required. Finally, by opening new avenues for interaction between researchers and students or members of the general public, e-science can influence both the questions scientists choose to address and the scope of their investigations. Transforming the promise of e-science into reality, however, is fraught with both technical and organizational challenges. The sheer volume of data records (50+ Tb/year) and observation density pose significant challenges for observatory and researcher alike, requiring new data mining approaches to be developed. Evolving and sometimes competing data format standards must be grappled with. Questions of data reliability and security must be answered. New protocols for protecting intellectual property within an open data environment must be defined. Ground rules for providing equitable access to finite shared resources (eg. underwater camera control time) must be defined. Cultural, institutional and motivational barriers to distributed decision-making and virtual team coordination must be overcome. NEPTUNE Canada is working to address the many challenges of e-science through a wide range of possible solutions. To help researchers make more optimal use of our large and growing data archives, we are developing a facility that allows users to upload and run custom data analysis routines on NEPTUNE Canada servers. Code authors will be able to retain privacy of over their routines, or if desired, publish their code for sharing and possible additional development with the larger user community. NEPTUNE Canada is developing other tools in the form of web and mobile applications for data search and subscription, event detection, interactive data plotting and real-time collaborative multi-user device control. Other custom tools will give users the ability to search, browse and annotate streaming media, then integrate and compile playlists},

abstract = {We live in interesting times. Portents of impending catastrophe pervade the literature, calling us to action in the face of unmanageable volumes of scientific data. But it isn't so much data generation per se, but the systematic burial of the knowledge embodied in those data that poses the problem: there is so much information available that we simply no longer know what we know, and finding what we want is hard - too hard. The knowledge we seek is often fragmentary and disconnected, spread thinly across thousands of databases and millions of articles in thousands of journals. The intellectual energy required to search this array of data-archives, and the time and money this wastes, has led several researchers to challenge the methods by which we traditionally commit newly acquired facts and knowledge to the scientific record. We present some of these initiatives here - a whirlwind tour of recent projects to transform scholarly publishing paradigms, culminating in Utopia and the Semantic Biochemical Journal experiment. With their promises to provide new ways of interacting with the literature, and new and more powerful tools to access and extract the knowledge sequestered within it, we ask what advances they make and what obstacles to progress still exist? We explore these questions, and, as you read on, we invite you to engage in an experiment with us, a real-time test of a new technology to rescue data from the dormant pages of published documents. We ask you, please, to read the instructions carefully. The time has come: you may turn over your papers...},

abstract = {The rapid increase in biological data acquisition has made computational analysis essential to research in the life sciences. However, the myriad of software tools to analyze this data were developed in diverse settings, without the capability to interact with one another or to capture the information necessary to reproduce an analysis. The burden of maintaining analytical provenance is therefore placed on the individual scientist. As a consequence, publications in biomedical research usually do not contain sufficient information for reproduction of the presented results. To alleviate these problems, we created a computational genomics environment called GenePattern which tracks the steps in the analysis of genomic data. Recently, in collaboration with Microsoft, we linked GenePattern to Microsoft Word. This resulting combination provides a Reproducible Research System that enables users to link analytical tools into workflows, to automatically record their work, to transparently embed that *recording* into a publication without ever leaving their word processing environment, and importantly to allow exact reproduction of published results.},

abstract = {Digital media and communication networks have become an important cyberinfrastructure to enable new levels of interactions in organizations and communities. A complicated knowledge network of individuals, documents, data, concepts, and their interconnections forms a virtual knowledge repository. To be more effective in using these resources, knowledge discovery tools are crucial for an organization and individual users to identify the right expertise or knowledge resources from this large "multidimensional network." Cyberinfrastructure Knowledge Networks on the Web (CI-KNOW) is a suite of Web-based tools that facilitates discovery of resources within communities. CI-KNOW implements a network recommendation system that incorporates social motivations for why we create, maintain, and dissolve our knowledge network ties. The network data is captured by automated harvesting of digital resources using Web crawlers, text miners, tagging tools that automatically generate community-oriented metadata, and scientometric data such as co-authorship and citations. Based on this knowledge network, the CI-KNOW recommender system produces personalized search results through two steps: identify matching entities according to their metadata and network statistics and select the best fits according to requester's perspectives and connections in social networks. Integrated with community Web portals, CI-KNOW navigation and auditing portlets provide analysis and visualization tools for community members and serves as a research testbed to examine social theories on individuals' motivations for seeking expertise from specific resources (people, documents, datasets, and etc.). As a proof-of-concept, this paper demonstrates how CI-KNOW, integrated with the NCI-supported Tobacco Informatics Grid (TobIG), facilitates knowledge sharing in the tobacco control research community.},

@misc{DonohoDavidLGavish2011,
abstract = {We propose that scientific publications recognize the primacy of computational results -- figures,tables, and charts -- and follow a protocol we have developed which asks publishers for subtle, easy changes in article appearance, asks authors for simple easy changes in a few lines of code in their programs and word processors, and yet has very far-reaching and we think lasting consequences. The effect of these small changes will be the following. Each author would permanently register each computational result in a published article (figure, table, computed number in in-line text) with a unique universal result identifier (URI). Each figure or table appearing in a published article would have its URI clearly indicated next to that item: a string that permanently and uniquely identifies that computational result. In our proposal, an archive, run by the publisher under the standard client/server architecture described here, will respond to queries about the URI and provide: (a) the figure/table itself; (b) metadata about the figure's creation; (c) (with permissions) data from the figure/table itself; (d) (with permissions) a related figure/table, obtained by changing the underlying parameters that created the original figure, but keeping everything else about the figure's creation the same. To better evoke the whole package we propose -- which consists of URI's, of specific content associated to URI's, and specific server processes that record and serve up content, we call the whole package -- a URI, its associated content and server behaviors -- a Verifable Computational Result (VCR). Our talk will describe an existing implementation of this idea and the advantages to journals, scientists, and government agencies of this approach.},

abstract = {PNAS article classification is rooted in long-standing disciplinary divisions that do not necessarily reflect the structure of modern scientific research. We reevaluate that structure using latent pattern models from statistical machine learning, also known as mixed-membership models, that identify semantic structure in co-occurrence of words in the abstracts and references. Our findings suggest that the latent dimensionality of patterns underlying PNAS research articles in the Biological Sciences is only slightly larger than the number of categories currently in use, but it differs substantially in the content of the categories. Further, the number of articles that are listed under multiple categories is only a small fraction of what it should be. These findings together with the sensitivity analyses suggest ways to reconceptualize the organization of papers published in PNAS.},

@article{Bollen2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intricate maps of science have been created from citation data to visualize the structure of scientific activity. However, most scientific publications are now accessed online. Scholarly web portals record detailed log data at a scale that exceeds the number of all existing citations combined. Such log data is recorded immediately upon publication and keeps track of the sequences of user requests (clickstreams) that are issued by a variety of users across many different domains. Given these advantages of log datasets over citation data, we investigate whether they can produce high-resolution, more current maps of science. METHODOLOGY: Over the course of 2007 and 2008, we collected nearly 1 billion user interactions recorded by the scholarly web portals of some of the most significant publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia. The resulting reference data set covers a significant part of world-wide use of scholarly web portals in 2006, and provides a balanced coverage of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. A journal clickstream model, i.e. a first-order Markov chain, was extracted from the sequences of user interactions in the logs. The clickstream model was validated by comparing it to the Getty Research Institute's Architecture and Art Thesaurus. The resulting model was visualized as a journal network that outlines the relationships between various scientific domains and clarifies the connection of the social sciences and humanities to the natural sciences. CONCLUSIONS: Maps of science resulting from large-scale clickstream data provide a detailed, contemporary view of scientific activity and correct the underrepresentation of the social sciences and humanities that is commonly found in citation data.},

@article{Gargouri2010,
abstract = {Background
Articles whose authors have supplemented subscription-based access to the publisher's version by self-archiving their own final draft to make it accessible free for all on the web (“Open Access”, OA) are cited significantly more than articles in the same journal and year that have not been made OA. Some have suggested that this “OA Advantage” may not be causal but just a self-selection bias, because authors preferentially make higher-quality articles OA. To test this we compared self-selective self-archiving with mandatory self-archiving for a sample of 27,197 articles published 2002–2006 in 1,984 journals.

Methdology/Principal Findings
The OA Advantage proved just as high for both. Logistic regression analysis showed that the advantage is independent of other correlates of citations (article age; journal impact factor; number of co-authors, references or pages; field; article type; or country) and highest for the most highly cited articles. The OA Advantage is real, independent and causal, but skewed. Its size is indeed correlated with quality, just as citations themselves are (the top 20\% of articles receive about 80\% of all citations).

Conclusions/Significance
The OA advantage is greater for the more citable articles, not because of a quality bias from authors self-selecting what to make OA, but because of a quality advantage, from users self-selecting what to use and cite, freed by OA from the constraints of selective accessibility to subscribers only. It is hoped that these findings will help motivate the adoption of OA self-archiving mandates by universities, research institutions and research funders.},

@article{Ioannidis2005,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {This paper presents an epidemiological study investigating the effects of long-term air pollution exposure on public health in Scotland, focusing on the 4 major urban areas, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. In particular, the associations between respiratory hospital admissions in 2005 and exposure to both PM(10) and NO(2) between 2002 and 2004 are estimated using a small-area ecological design. The implementation of such studies requires careful consideration of a number of statistical issues, including how to model spatial correlation, identifiability of the model parameters, and the possible effects of ecological bias. The results show that long-term exposures (over 3 years) to PM(10) and NO(2) are significantly associated with respiratory hospital admissions in Edinburgh and Glasgow, whereas the risks for Aberdeen and Dundee are generally positive but nonsignificant.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Modern biological experiments create vast amounts of data which are geographically distributed. These datasets consist of petabytes of raw data and billions of documents. Yet to the best of our knowledge, a search engine technology that searches and cross-links all different data types in life sciences does not exist. We have developed a prototype distributed scientific search engine technology, 'Sciencenet', which facilitates rapid searching over this large data space. By 'bringing the search engine to the data', we do not require server farms. This platform also allows users to contribute to the search index and publish their large-scale data to support e-Science. Furthermore, a community-driven method guarantees that only scientific content is crawled and presented. Our peer-to-peer approach is sufficiently scalable for the science web without performance or capacity tradeoff. Availability and Implementation: The free to use search portal web page and the downloadable client are accessible at: http://sciencenet.kit.edu. The web portal for index administration is implemented in ASP.NET, the 'AskMe' experiment publisher is written in Python 2.7, and the backend 'YaCy' search engine is based on Java 1.6. CONTACT: urban.liebel@kit.edu Supplementary Material: Detailed instructions and descriptions can be found on the project homepage: http://sciencenet.kit.edu.},

In this study we present BioTorrents, a website that allows open access sharing of scientific data and uses the popular BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing technology. BioTorrents allows files to be transferred rapidly due to the sharing of bandwidth across multiple institutions and provides more reliable file transfers due to the built-in error checking of the file sharing technology. BioTorrents contains multiple features, including keyword searching, category browsing, RSS feeds, torrent comments, and a discussion forum. BioTorrents is available at http://www.biotorrents.net.},

abstract = {Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these \&\#8220;data stories\&\#8221; differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.},

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the citation history of 85 cancer microarray clinical trial publications with respect to the availability of their data. The 48\% of trials with publicly available microarray data received 85\% of the aggregate citations. Publicly available data was significantly (p = 0.006) associated with a 69\% increase in citations, independently of journal impact factor, date of publication, and author country of origin using linear regression. SIGNIFICANCE: This correlation between publicly available data and increased literature impact may further motivate investigators to share their detailed research data.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 technologies are finding their way into academics: specialized social bookmarking services allow researchers to store and share scientific literature online. By bookmarking and tagging articles, academic prosumers generate new information about resources, i.e. usage statistics and content description of scientific journals. Given the lack of global download statistics, the authors propose the application of social bookmarking data to journal evaluation. For a set of 45 physics journals all 13,608 bookmarks from CiteULike, Connotea and BibSonomy to documents published between 2004 and 2008 were analyzed. This article explores bookmarking data in STM and examines in how far it can be used to describe the perception of periodicals by the readership. Four basic indicators are defined, which analyze different aspects of usage: Usage Ratio, Usage Diffusion, Article Usage Intensity and Journal Usage Intensity.

abstract = {Background
Figures are important experimental results that are typically reported in full-text bioscience articles. Bioscience researchers need to access figures to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. On the other hand, the sheer volume of bioscience literature has made it difficult to access figures. Therefore, we are developing an intelligent figure search engine (http://figuresearch.askhermes.org). Existing research in figure search treats each figure equally, but we introduce a novel concept of “figure ranking”: figures appearing in a full-text biomedical article can be ranked by their contribution to the knowledge discovery.

Methodology/Findings
We empirically validated the hypothesis of figure ranking with over 100 bioscience researchers, and then developed unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) approaches to automatically rank figures. Evaluating on a collection of 202 full-text articles in which authors have ranked the figures based on importance, our best system achieved a weighted error rate of 0.2, which is significantly better than several other baseline systems we explored. We further explored a user interfacing application in which we built novel user interfaces (UIs) incorporating figure ranking, allowing bioscience researchers to efficiently access important figures. Our evaluation results show that 92\% of the bioscience researchers prefer as the top two choices the user interfaces in which the most important figures are enlarged. With our automatic figure ranking NLP system, bioscience researchers preferred the UIs in which the most important figures were predicted by our NLP system than the UIs in which the most important figures were randomly assigned. In addition, our results show that there was no statistical difference in bioscience researchers' preference in the UIs generated by automatic figure ranking and UIs by human ranking annotation.

Conclusion/Significance
The evaluation results conclude that automatic figure ranking and user interfacing as we reported in this study can be fully implemented in online publishing. The novel user interface integrated with the automatic figure ranking system provides a more efficient and robust way to access scientific information in the biomedical domain, which will further enhance our existing figure search engine to better facilitate accessing figures of interest for bioscientists.},

abstract = {Change is a fundamental ingredient of interaction patterns in biology, technology, the economy, and science itself: Interactions within and between organisms change; transportation patterns by air, land, and sea all change; the global financial flow changes; and the frontiers of scientific research change. Networks and clustering methods have become important tools to comprehend instances of these large-scale structures, but without methods to distinguish between real trends and noisy data, these approaches are not useful for studying how networks change. Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science: studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline.},

abstract = {Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at "quasi-baseline" (December 2004, 0-6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4-10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10-16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2\% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8\%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0\%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8\%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95\% Confidence Interval: 1.1-1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6\%], OA: 11 [5.2\%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4-4.7]; p < 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5-2.9]) in the first 4-10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5-5.5) 10-16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.},

abstract = {Increased public and private investments in large-scale team science initiatives over the past two decades have underscored the need to better understand how contextual factors influence the effectiveness of transdisciplinary scientific collaboration. Toward that goal, the findings from four distinct areas of research on team performance and collaboration are reviewed: (1) social psychological and management research on the effectiveness of teams in organizational and institutional settings; (2) studies of cyber-infrastructures (i.e., computer-based infrastructures) designed to support transdisciplinary collaboration across remote research sites; (3) investigations of community-based coalitions for health promotion; and (4) studies focusing directly on the antecedents, processes, and outcomes of scientific collaboration within transdisciplinary research centers and training programs. The empirical literature within these four domains reveals several contextual circumstances that either facilitate or hinder team performance and collaboration. A typology of contextual influences on transdisciplinary collaboration is proposed as a basis for deriving practical guidelines for designing, managing, and evaluating successful team science initiatives.},

Data processing, however, is often not described well enough to allow for reproduction, leading to exercises in “forensic bioinformatics” where raw data and reported results are used to infer what the methods must have been. Unfortunately, poor documentation can shift from an inconvenience to an active danger when it obscures not just methods but errors. In this talk, we examine several related papers using array-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials were allocated to treatment arms based on these results. However, we show in several case studies that the reported results incorporate several simple errors that could put patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common. We briefly discuss steps we are taking to avoid such errors in our own investigations.},

To explore the genetic contribution, we undertook a genome-wide association study of exceptional longevity (EL) in 1055 centenarians and 1267 controls. Using these data, we built a genetic model that includes 150 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found that it could predict EL with 77\% accuracy in an independent set of centenarians and controls. Further in silico analysis revealed that 90\% of centenarians can be grouped into 19 clusters characterized by different combinations of SNP genotypes-or genetic signatures-of varying predictive value. The different signatures, which attest to the genetic complexity of EL, correlated with differences in the prevalence and age of onset of age-associated diseases (e.g., dementia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) and may help dissect this complex phenotype into subphenotypes of healthy aging.},

abstract = {Objective To understand belief in a specific scientific claim by studying the pattern of citations among papers stating it. Design A complete citation network was constructed from all PubMed indexed English literature papers addressing the belief that amyloid, a protein accumulated in the brain in Alzheimers disease, is produced by and injures skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myositis. Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this network. Main outcome measures Citation bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining authority. Results The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding. Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

We then examine a range of new applications such as Zotero, Mendeley, Mekentosj Papers, MyNCBI, CiteULike, Connotea, and HubMed that exploit the Web to make these digital libraries more personal, sociable, integrated, and accessible places. We conclude with how these applications may begin to help achieve a digital defrost, and discuss some of the issues that will help or hinder this in terms of making libraries on the Web warmer places in the future, becoming resources that are considerably more useful to both humans and machines.},

@article{Gentleman2005,
abstract = {While scientific research and the methodologies involved have gone through substantial technological evolution the technology involved in the publication of the results of these endeavors has remained relatively stagnant. Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace the code with its output -- thereby providing the familiar, but limited, static document. In this paper we apply these concepts to a seminal paper in bioinformatics, namely The Molecular Classification of Cancer, Golub et al (1999).

@article{Savage2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many journals now require authors share their data with other investigators, either by depositing the data in a public repository or making it freely available upon request. These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoS's explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. CONCLUSIONS: We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.},

@article{Page2010,
abstract = {Although theWeb has transformed science publishing, scientific papers themselves are still essentially “black boxes”, with much of their content intended for human readers only. Typically, computer-readable metadata associated with an article is limited to bibliographic details. By expanding article metadata to include taxonomic names, identifiers for cited material (e.g., publications, sequences, specimens, and other data), and geographical coordinates, publishers could greatly increase the scientific value of their digital content. At the same time this will provide novel ways for users to discover and navigate through this content, beyond the relatively limited linkage provided by bibliographic citation. As a proof of concept, my entry in the Elsevier Grand Challenge extracted extended metadata from a set of articles from the journal Molecular phylogeny and evolution and used it to populate a entity-attribute-value database. A simple web interface to this database enables an enhanced display of the content of an article, including a map of localities mentioned either explicitly or implicitly (through links to geotagged data), taxonomic coverage, and both data and citation links. Metadata extraction was limited to information listed in tables in the articles, such as GenBank sequences and specimen codes. The body of the article wasn’t used, a restriction that was deliberate to demonstrate that making extended metadata available doesn’t require a journal’s publisher to make the full-text freely available (although this is desirable for other reasons)},

Such semantic enhancements are already being undertaken by leading STM publishers, and automated text processing will help these enhancements become affordable and routine. Publisher, editor, and author all have primary roles in that process; an incremental approach is needed. Publication of data and metadata to the Web make possible added-value ‘ecosystem services’; semantic publishing will bring substantial benefits to scholarly communication.},

abstract = {Galileo wrote that "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics"; his quantitative approach to understanding the natural world arguably marks the beginning of modern science. Nearly 400 years later, the fragmented teaching of science in our universities still leaves biology outside the quantitative and mathematical culture that has come to define the physical sciences and engineering. This strikes us as particularly inopportune at a time when opportunities for quantitative thinking about biological systems are exploding. We propose that a way out of this dilemma is a unified introductory science curriculum that fully incorporates mathematics and quantitative thinking.},

abstract = {Three commonly employed methods for lignin determination, i.e., the thioglycolic acid (TGA), the acetylbromide (AB), and the acid detergent fiber (ADF) method, were compared using leaves and xylem tissue from five species (Nicotiana tabacum, Populus x canescens, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur, and Picea abies). In each case, cell walls were isolated before lignin determination. Each of the three methods estimated a different lignin concentration in a given tissue, except for spruce wood. The "lignin" concentration determined with the AB method was strongly dependent on whether or not the cell walls were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to remove covalently bound aromatic nonligneous components before lignin determination. Lignin concentrations determined in hydrolyzed cell walls of different tissues and species by the AB method showed a good correlation with those obtained by the TGA method and, thus, were convertible. In contrast, gravimetrically estimated ADF lignins did not or only moderately correlate with lignins measured with methods based on the UV absorbance of the solubilized lignin degradation products. Leaves of a given species generally contained higher ADF-lignin concentrations than the corresponding stem tissue. Both ADF and TGA lignin data of beech were used to calibrate near-infrared reflectance spectra (NIRS) for lignin prediction. Both NIRS calibration procedures gave good statistical fits with correlation coefficients close to 1, indicating that TGA and ADF lignin concentrations of beech can be estimated by NIRS with high accuracy. However, the two calibrations were based on different empirical terms, showing that TGA and ADF lignins did not share the same physical basis for calibration. C/N analysis revealed the presence of 3.1 and 1.4\% nitrogen in ADF lignins of beech leaves and wood, respectively. The major fraction of this nitrogen was recovered in amino acids, which corresponded to 14\% and 3\% protein in ADF lignins of leaves and wood, respectively. These results show that ADF lignins contain significant concentrations of lignin-bound proteins, which renders this method unsuitable to determine genuine lignin.},

@article{Johansson1986,
abstract = {Changes in the lignin fraction of spruce and pine needle litter were followed by four different methods: Klason lignin, phloroglucinol lignin, dioxane-water-HCl-lignin and alkaline CuO oxidation. The decomposition patterns of the lignins studied were different, the largest differences between the methods being obtained for the spruce needles. Depending on the method used, between 36 and 46\% of the original amount of lignin remained in the pine needles and about 30–61\% in the spruce needles after 3 yr of decomposition. The decomposition rates of the various lignin pools were highly correlated with the loss in mass of the litter. The phloroglucinol lignin was decomposed significantly faster (P < 0.001) in the spruce needles than in the pine needles for as long as the decomposition process was followed. During decomposition of the litter, the residual amount of Klason lignin was correlated with the residual amounts of the other lignins. The application of the different methods to litter decomposition studies is discussed.},

@article{Speranza2005,
abstract = {Wood is the main renewable material on Earth and is largely used as building material and in paper-pulp manufacturing. This review describes the composition of lignocellulosic materials, the different processes by which fungi are able to alter wood, including decay patterns caused by white, brown, and soft-rot fungi, and fungal staining of wood. The chemical, enzymatic, and molecular aspects of the fungal attack of lignin, which represents the key step in wood decay, are also discussed. Modern analytical techniques to investigate fungal degradation and modification of the lignin polymer are reviewed, as are the different oxidative enzymes (oxidoreductases) involved in lignin degradation. These include laccases, high redox potential ligninolytic peroxidases (lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase), and oxidases. Special emphasis is given to the reactions catalyzed, their synergistic action on lignin, and the structural bases for their unique catalytic properties. Broadening our knowledge of lignocellulose biodegradation processes should contribute to better control of wood-decaying fungi, as well as to the development of new biocatalysts of industrial interest based on these organisms and their enzymes.},

@article{Martinez2011,
abstract = {Selective modification/degradation of the main plant polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) was investigated in a hardwood after white and brown-rot fungal decay under environmental conditions. The chemical changes produced in the plant cell wall were analysed in situ, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the gel state, and analytical pyrolysis. Two-dimensional (2D) NMR of the white-rotted wood showed only cellulose and (deacetylated) hemicellulose, and the complete removal of lignin. On the other hand, the brown-rotted wood showed the nearly complete absence of polysaccharides, while the main features of lignin structure, as revealed by 2D-NMR, could be observed. These included well-resolved aromatic and side-chain cross-signals, although the intensity of the latter signals was lowered indicating a reduction in the number of side-chain linkages ($\beta$-O-4' and $\beta$-$\beta$') per aromatic unit (their relative abundances remaining unchanged). These results contrast with a recent study concluding that the aromatic polymer after brown-rot decay is not longer recognized as lignin. Some oxidative alteration of lignin during brown-rot decay was evidenced and, more interesting, several compounds with 3-methoxycatechol skeleton were released upon pyrolysis. Lignin demethylation is consistent with recent brown-rot transcriptomic/secretomic studies showing overexpression of methanol oxidase, which could use lignin-derived methanol to generate the peroxide required for cellulose depolymerization via Fenton chemistry.},

@article{Reale,
abstract = {Lignin, a resistant cell-wall constituent of all vascular plants that consists of ether and carbon-linked methoxyphenols, is still far from being structurally described in detail. The main problem in its structural elucidation is the difficulty of isolating lignin from other wood components without damaging lignin itself. Furthermore, the high number and variegated forms of linkages that occur between the monomeric units and the chemical resistance of certain ether bonds limit the extent to which analytical and degradation procedures can be used to elucidate the lignin structure. Most of our present knowledge about the molecular structure of lignin is based on the analysis of monomers, dimers or, at the most, tetramers of degraded isolated lignins. Mass spectrometry (MS), which offers advantages in terms of speed, specificity, and sensitivity, has revealed to be a very powerful technique in the structural elucidation of lignins, in combination with the great number of chemical and thermal degradation methods available in the study of lignin. Moreover, the recent development of new ionization techniques in MS-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS-has provided new possibilities to also analyze the undegraded lignin macromolecule.},

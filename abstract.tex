The degradation of plant polymers in litter decay determines quality and quantity of recalcitrant carbon input to soils. Nevertheless, the involved transformations remain unclear. Beech litter from four different sites, varying in N, P and inital soluble C content was incubated over 15 month. We follow the accumulation or depletion of lignin, carbohydrates and other lipophilic compounds by pyrolysis-GC/MS. 
In three of the four sites, we found a clear preference of carbohydrates over lignin decomposition during the first 6 month. The fourth site, characterized by low N and high soluble C content, shows no such preference, degrading lignin at the same rate as bulk litter biomass.

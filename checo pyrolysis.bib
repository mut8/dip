abstract = {The links among the changes in litter chemistry, the activity of extracellular enzymes and the microbial community composition were observed in Quercus petraea litter. Three phases of decomposition could be distinguished. In the early 4-month stage, with high activities of $\beta$-glucosidase, $\beta$-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase, 16.4\% of litter was decomposed. Hemicelluloses were rapidly removed while cellulose and lignin degradation was slow. In months 4-12, with high endocellulase and endoxylanase activities, decomposition of cellulose prevailed and 31.8\% of litter mass was lost. After the third phase of decomposition until month 24 with high activity of ligninolytic enzymes, the litter mass loss reached 67.9\%. After 2 years of decay, cellulose decomposition was almost complete and most of the remaining polysaccharides were in the form of hemicelluloses. Fungi largely dominated over bacteria as leaf endophytes and also in the litter immediately before contact with soil, and this fungal dominance lasted until month 4. Bacterial biomass (measured as phospholipid fatty acid content) in litter increased with time but also changed qualitatively, showing an increasing number of Actinobacteria. This paper shows that the dynamics of decomposition of individual litter components changes with time in accordance with the changes in the microbial community composition and its production of extracellular enzymes.},

@article{Nierop2004a,
abstract = {Each plant species has a unique chemical composition, and also within a given plant the various tissues differ from one another in their chemistry. These different compositions can be traced back after decay of the plant parts when they are transformed into soil organic matter (SOM). As a result, the composition of SOM reflects not only the plant origin, but also the various tissues, and the composition consequently provides an estimate of the contribution of above-ground vs. below-ground litter. From the latter distribution the extent of bioturbation (mixing of above-ground litter with the mineral soil) can be assessed. Application of thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) releases all typical cutin- and suberin-derived aliphatic monomers (mono-, di- and trihydroxyalkanoic acids, alpha,omega-alkanedioic acids) as their methyl esters and/or ethers in a rapid manner. Using the distribution of omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids that are present in pine needle cutin (C(12) and C(14)) and not in root suberin, and those that are present in roots but not in needles (C(20) and C(22)), the extent of bioturbation (mixing of above-ground plant litter with the mineral soil) can be assessed. Similarly, the (9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid+9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid)/(C(20) + C(22) alpha,omega-alkanedioic acids) ratio reflects the degree of bioturbation. Three mineral soil profiles under Corsican pine with an A horizon that exhibited extensive bioturbation phenomena, and underlying C horizons with hardly any or no bioturbation, were investigated in order to examine the applicability of such an approach. It appeared that the A horizons contained all four mentioned omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids, while the C horizons contained virtually only the C(20) and C(22) members. The results not only suggest that bioturbation occurs in the A horizons, but also that possible illuviation or other transport mechanisms of omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids seem hardly ever or never to occur, which is a prerequisite for applying this biomarker approach in assessing degrees of bioturbation.},

abstract = {A collection of tannins extracted from various plant species was subjected to thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The products obtained included 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes, derived from A rings of condensed tannins (CTs), and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, and derivatives as major products from the B ring. 1,2,4-Tri- and two tetramethoxybenzenes were also detected in most analyses. Correlation analyses revealed that they were derived from the B ring, with 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene being derived from a procyanidin (PC) B ring and 1,2,3,5-tetramethoxybenzene from a prodelphinidin (PD) ring. Tannins from species that contained both CT and hydrolyzable tannin (HT) produced mainly permethylated gallic acid moieties upon THM, and the products derived from CTs were less abundant. Most likely, the ester-bound HTs are more easily transmethylated than the cleavage and methylation of the C-C and C-O linked CTs. Statistical analyses of the THM products and 13C NMR data of the tannins showed good correlations between the B ring hydroxylation and the di- and trimethoxybenzenes observed. Using the ratio of the methyl esters of 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid only provided good correlations of the percent PC as well. Furthermore, the 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes may serve as good markers of tannins in plant, soil, sediment or other samples as analyzed by THM.},

@article{Buurman2009c,
abstract = {Humic acids have been widely investigated by spectroscopic methods. especially NMR and FTIR, and they are known to show significant differences according to their origin. Low resolution methods such as NMR and FTIR. however cannot easily distinguish different input sources or establish relations between SOM chemistry and vegetation or land use in general. High resolution methods, such as analytical pyrolysis and pyrolysis combined with methylation do offer such possibilities. Therefore, HAs from five reference soils called the Eurosoils, including a Vertic Cambisol (E1, Italy), a Rendzina (E2, Greece), a Dystic Cambisol (E3, Great Britain), an Orthic Luvisol (E4, France) and an Orthic Podzol (E5, Germany), that were previously characterized a.o. by NMR, FTIR and ESR, were also analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) and subsequent analysis by GC/MS. The Orthic Podzol sample showed the largest aliphaticity, and the strongest degradation of aliphatics and lignin. The Dystric Cambisol featured the least decomposed HA, which was reflected by a large content of long-chain alkanes, and little lignin degradation. Both the Dystric Cambisol and the Orthic Luvisol HAs contained a significant amount of microbial organic matter. Polyaromatics, which indicate the presence of charred material, were most abundant in the Vertic Cambisol and the Podzol HAs and lowest in the Dystric Cambisol and the Rendzina HAs. THM was able to distinguish between the various vegetations/land uses. Although quantifications by NMR and py-GC/MS are essentially different, the general results largely coincided. NMR appears to underestimate aromaticity and overestimate aliphaticity, but a molecular mixing model yielded reasonable correlations between NMR and pyrolysis data. Classification by 'degradation state' based on py-GC/MS largely coincided with acidity determined by titration, but FTIR data did not coincide. Py-GC/MS, with its much larger resolution, is a better tool to distinguish effects of vegetation, microbial input, and degradation. HA's produce the same variety of compounds upon pyrolysis as total SOM extracts and are therefore chemically not more simple than SOM. HA chemistry, however can be understood in the light of land use history and SOM dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This season is often a time of reflection on the year winding down. Looking back, what has had the greatest impact on our industry this year? For many in our industry, the topic dominating boardroom discussions in 2010 was the same as 2009: budget challenges. In a world of changing technology and more demanding content delivery expectations, the current economic climate brought to society publishers unprecedented budget challenges—challenges intensified by constricted institutional funding that left librarians across all segments fighting to salvage what they could of their budgets while searching for ways to reduce costs. How did the economic downturn impact journal subscription prices? To follow is a summary of price trends from a group of approximately 250 publications appearing in the Allen Press Buyer’s Guide to Scientific, Medical, and Scholarly Journals™.},

@article{Duval2006a,
abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to CAMA06, the "1st International ACM Workshop on Contextualized Attention Metadata: Collecting, Managing and Exploiting of Rich Usage Information".The focus of the workshop is the capture and analysis of user behavior, so as to enable more effective and efficient support for the tasks and activities that the user is engaging in. This research has some direct implications in the real world: information systems that address users needs in a more direct and transparent way are more valuable. Indeed, this can be translated in some contexts in direct monetary metrics, e.g. by making money through targeted advertisements. In other contexts, there may be a less direct monetary gain, as in the case of fundamental research support or community strengthening initiatives.In order to increase the relevance of information and services further, usage data are increasingly used for "mass customization". Thus, the value and pertinence of data about the user and her interactions with systems and applications becomes increasingly obvious. As an example, tracking user interaction with and across websites is a major area for global services (including free ones like Google Analytics). Furthermore, several organizations have set out to collect data about user interactions across websites, e.g. AttentionTrust (http://www.attentiontrust.org/). Google's GMail illustrates how this kind of information can be used for targeted advertisements based on continuous analysis of incoming and outgoing email traffic.The main concern in all these efforts is capturing and analyzing the interactions of users, trying to figure out why they do what they do when they do it. The data captured, called attention metadata, typically include some information about the user, as well as about her interactions with an application (understood in a broad sense here). One issue is to be able to gather such data across different systems, which requires some form of user identification, with the associated concerns around security and privacy. The interactions depend on the type of tool, and can include following links (e.g. within a browser), activating user interface widgets (e.g. in a closed information system like SAP), following usage patterns (e.g. at specific websites), submitting search terms and selecting results (e.g. in a search engine session).There are two general approaches to capture attention metadata: Either the data is captured intrusively by asking the user to complete (online) questionnaires or through direct user observations that the user may or may not be aware of. Intrusive methods are generally less reliable. Data gathered by direct observation is more likely to be "true" as the user is less aware of the observation. More importantly, direct observation does not interfere with the primary goal of the user: after all, she is using an application to pursue her own interest, and any overhead involved in capturing what she is trying to do, why and how is just that: overhead, that should be avoided if at all possible. Sources for attention metadata are log files of servers and applications (e.g. browsers and email clients, chat tools, office tools, etc.), which can be obtained without disturbing the user. In order to draw on the benefits of both methods, several systems employ a hybrid method using elements from observation and enquiry.The analysis of attention metadata can focus either on the user (or group of users) or the application. Examples of the outcome of such analysis are statistics about the information, e.g. the number of times it has been read or downloaded, or about the user, e.g. the information she read, downloaded, exchanged with friends, etc. The most advanced analysis allows for some conclusions on the user goals, e.g. the Personal Reader (http://www.personal-reader.de/) that tries to provide additional information to a webpage read by a user. Such information can be fed back to the information system, in order to enable more targeted services.In general, the collection and analysis methods developed so far have some shortcomings. Attention metadata is mostly captured in one application only. The formats used to represent and store attention are highly diverse and heterogeneous, which makes the combination of such information over several applications very tedious and time-consuming. Furthermore, there are no standards to exchange attention information across system boundaries, e.g. between the desktop and the service provider.The combination of attention metadata from various sources provides a more complete view of user interactions. For example, such combination makes it possible to capture the whole information flow on the user desktop, from obtaining information, processing activities like storing, reading, distributing, deleting, and the repurposing of the information in newly authored documents. We call the combination of attention metadata from heterogeneous sources contextualized attention metadata of users. Contextualization of attention metadata refers to capturing data about the context in which a certain activity is carried out. For example, while writing a scientific paper, the author carries out certain tasks, e.g. writing the document, searching information on the web and on his desktop, sharing his thoughts about the paper with his co-authors via chat and email, drawing related graphs, etc. The task of capturing all these activities requires a scheme to include all the various types of user and activity metadata as well as its relation, hence contextualized attention metadata.The recently introduced AttentionXML (http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml) specification sets out to capture user interactions in terms of interoperable attention metadata. The core of AttentionXML is a schema that describes metadata on how people use information, e.g. what people read, comment on or listen to. Typical applications of AttentionXML focus on the attention that users spend on web pages, news feeds and blogs.Important as the AttentionXML specification is in bootstrapping "attention ecology", we believe that it is somewhat limited in the scope of attention metadata that it includes. For example, the schema does not allow capturing information about downloading, viewing or editing documents, applications and contexts where objects were used. That is why we have proposed an extension to AttentionXML that allows us to significantly broaden the usage scenarios of attention metadata. We call this new schema the contextualized attention metadata schema -- CAMs (http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/empirical/attention.php).Now that the schema is in place, various tools emerge to capture attention metadata, and the focus is shifting to the analysis of collected attention metadata. Apart from the technical problems of dealing with large amounts of data, the open questions deal with problems like user identification, classification of users and activities, deep mining for behavioral patterns, etc. Another issue that needs to be urgently addressed in a better way is security and privacy. Attention metadata includes highly personal information so that secure solutions have to be provided to ensure the integrity and privacy of the data, e.g. enabling the user to have full control over his attention metadata at all times. Last but not least, the integration of the new possibilities arising out of the usage of attention metadata have to be integrated into existing system to enhance their capabilities, e.g. in terms of highly targeted and personalized information provision.The CAMA 2006 workshop addresses the above outlined issues in a variety of presentations. As an opening, Steve Gillmor will elaborate on the future of attention metadata in commercial settings. The overview on the usage of attention metadata in real-world systems will include a brief discussion of the socio-technological perspective of attention metadata, thus outlining some of the more social problems like data-ownership. Furthermore, we will discuss the experiences with capturing and analyzing attention metadata, e.g. in a library environment, for the support of the corporate decision making process and in learning scenarios. Last but not least, we discuss several issues in real-world settings focusing on the capturing process, like how an attention recorder allows capturing highly detailed attention metadata or how the user file system can be mined for attention metadata.},

@article{Mathys2011,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The 1980s marked the occasion when Geographical Information System (GIS) technology was broadly introduced into the geo-spatial community through the establishment of a strong GIS industry. This technology quickly disseminated across many countries, and has now become established as an important research, planning and commercial tool for a wider community that includes organisations in the public and private health sectors. The broad acceptance of GIS technology and the nature of its functionality have meant that numerous datasets have been created over the past three decades. Most of these datasets have been created independently, and without any structured documentation systems in place. However, search and retrieval systems can only work if there is a mechanism for datasets existence to be discovered and this is where proper metadata creation and management can greatly help. This situation must be addressed through support mechanisms such as Web-based portal technologies, metadata editor tools, automation, metadata standards and guidelines and collaborative efforts with relevant individuals and organisations. Engagement with data developers or administrators should also include a strategy of identifying the benefits associated with metadata creation and publication. FINDINGS: The establishment of numerous Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs), and other Internet resources, is a testament to the recognition of the importance of supporting good data management and sharing practices across the geographic information community. These resources extend to health informatics in support of research, public services and teaching and learning. This paper identifies many of these resources available to the UK academic health informatics community. It also reveals the reluctance of many spatial data creators across the wider UK academic community to use these resources to create and publish metadata, or deposit their data in repositories for sharing. The Go-Geo! service is introduced as an SDI developed to provide UK academia with the necessary resources to address the concerns surrounding metadata creation and data sharing. The Go-Geo! portal, Geodoc metadata editor tool, ShareGeo spatial data repository, and a range of other support resources, are described in detail. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a variety of resources available for the health research and public health sector to use for managing and sharing their data. The Go-Geo! service is one resource which offers an SDI for the eclectic range of disciplines using GIS in UK academia, including health informatics. The benefits of data management and sharing are immense, and in these times of cost restraints, these resources can be seen as solutions to find cost savings which can be reinvested in more research.},

@article{FLETCHER,
abstract = {Peer reviewed journals throughout the world have adopted similar review practices in an effort to select the best among submitted manuscripts and to improve their quality before publication. These practices have been justified mainly by tradition and argument. Considering the high stakes of publication, peer review practices should be supported by scientific evidence that they improve outcomes (such as better published manuscripts) and by sound ethical reasoning that they are justifiable. A small but growing number of scientific studies of peer review can help guide the choice of peer review practices, but their generalisability is limited by the great variety of journals, reviewers, and editors, and the evidence for the overall effectiveness of current peer review practices is not clear cut. Nevertheless, there is an empirical basis for such practices as selecting and instructing reviewers, masking them to the author’s identity, and asking them to sign reviews. Participation in peer review also has important beneficial effects on the medical community as a whole, whether or not the manuscript is published, by providing a vehicle for communication among scholars and by reinforcing ethical standards in the conduct of research. The cost of peer review is only a small proportion of the total budget of the journal. In the absence of conclusive evidence that usual peer review practices are best, variation in peer review practices is defensible, but should be accompanied by vigorous debate about their value and strong research into their effectiveness.},

In order to support the emergence of Grid-based scientific collaboration, new models of e-Science working methods are needed. Scientific collaboration involves production and manipulation of various artefacts. Based on work done in the software engineering field, this paper proposes models and tools which will support the representation and production of such artefacts. It is necessary to provide facilities to classify, organise, acquire, process, share, and reuse artefacts generated during collaborative working. The concept of a "design space" will be used to organise scientific design and the composition of experiments, and methods such as self-organising maps will be used to support the reuse of existing artefacts. It is proposed that this work can be carried out and evaluated in the UK e-Science community, using an "industry as laboratory" approach to the research, building on the knowledge, expertise, and experience of those directly involved in e-Science.},

@article{Weale2004,
abstract = {Background: Current methods of measuring the quality of journals assume that citations of articles within journals are normally distributed. Furthermore using journal impact factors to measure the quality of individual articles is flawed if citations are not uniformly spread between articles. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of citations to articles and use the level of non-citation of articles within a journal as a measure of quality. This ranking method is compared with the impact factor, as calculated by ISI. Methods: Total citations gained by October 2003, for every original article and review published in current immunology (13125 articles; 105 journals) and surgical (17083 articles; 120 journals) fields during 2001 were collected using ISI Web of Science. Results: The distribution of citation of articles within an individual journal is mainly non-parametric throughout the literature. One sixth (16.7\%; IQR 13.619.2) of articles in a journal accrue half the total number of citations to that journal. There was a broader distribution of citation to articles in higher impact journals and in the field of immunology compared to surgery. 23.7\% (IQR 14.642.4) of articles had not yet been cited. Levels of non-citation varied between journals and subject fields. There was a significant negative correlation between the proportion of articles never cited and a journal's impact factor for both immunology (rho = -0.854) and surgery journals (rho = -0.924). Conclusion: Ranking journals by impact factor and non-citation produces similar results. Using a non-citation rate is advantageous as it creates a clear distinction between how citation analysis is used to determine the quality of a journal (low level of non-citation) and an individual article (citation counting). Non-citation levels should therefore be made available for all journals.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on methods to study patterns of collaboration in co-authorship networks at the mesoscopic level. We combine qualitative methods (participant interviews) with quantitative methods (network analysis) and demonstrate the application and value of our approach in a case study comparing three research fields in chemistry. A mesoscopic level of analysis means that in addition to the basic analytic unit of the individual researcher as node in a co-author network, we base our analysis on the observed modular structure of co-author networks. We interpret the clustering of authors into groups as bibliometric footprints of the basic collective units of knowledge production in a research specialty. We find two types of coauthor-linking patterns between author clusters that we interpret as representing two different forms of cooperative behavior, transfer-type connections due to career migrations or one-off services rendered, and stronger, dedicated inter-group collaboration. Hence the generic coauthor network of a research specialty can be understood as the overlay of two distinct types of cooperative networks between groups of authors publishing in a research specialty. We show how our analytic approach exposes field specific differences in the social organization of research.},

abstract = {Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at "quasi-baseline" (December 2004, 0-6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4-10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10-16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2\% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8\%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0\%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8\%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95\% Confidence Interval: 1.1-1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6\%], OA: 11 [5.2\%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4-4.7]; p < 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5-2.9]) in the first 4-10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5-5.5) 10-16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.},

@article{Groth2010,
abstract = {As the amount of scholarly communication increases, it is increasingly difficult for specific core scientific statements to be found, connected and curated. Additionally, the redundancy of these statements in multiple fora makes it difficult to determine attribution, quality and provenance. To tackle these challenges, the Concept Web Alliance has promoted the notion of nanopublications (core scientific statements with associated context). In this document, we present a model of nanopublications along with a Named Graph/RDF serialization of the model. Importantly, the serialization is defined completely using already existing community-developed technologies. Finally, we discuss the importance of aggregating nanopublications and the role that the Concept Wiki plays in facilitating it.},

@article{Bollen2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of scientific publications has traditionally been expressed in terms of citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. METHODOLOGY: We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.},

The cohort consists of 9076 patients treated by open radical prostatectomy at one of four US academic institutions 1987 - 2003. The primary analyses focused on 7765 patients without neoadjuvant therapy. The most well-known finding is that of a surgical "learning curve", with rates of prostate cancer cure strongly dependent on surgeon experience. In this "data note", we provide the raw data set, as well as well-annotated programming code for the main analyses. Data include markers of cancer severity (stage, grade and prostate-specific antigen level), cancer outcome, and surgeon variables such as training and experience.},

abstract = {Chitin is an insoluble component in the shells of several molluscan species. It is thought to play important roles, in biomineralization and shell structure. To date, however, reports are scarce and sometimes contradictory, and suffer from methodological problems. Only in a single cephalopod species has the chitin been identified as beta-chitin. We present data on chitin occurrence in 22 species of shell-bearing Mollusca (Conchifera) and Polyplacophora, including the first evidence for scaphopods, based on pyrolysis gas chromatography, mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Pyrolysis GC-MS detected chitin in every tested member of the Conchifera. IR spectroscopy before and after chitinase treatment revealed at least three distinct patterns of peak changes. The contents of the insoluble shell organics included not only chitin and proteins, but also insoluble polysaccharides, e.g., glucan. We conclude that chitin was present in the last common ancestor of the Conchifera and that its abundance in the shell matrix depends on the differentiation of the shell.},

@article{Green2010,
abstract = {During the investigation of problems with the physical handling of sludge from a saline activated sludge wastewater system, pyrolysis/GC/MS was used in an attempt to determine whether changes in the bacterial population in the sludge were occurring. The pyrolysis GC/MS analysis revealed an unknown peak among other typical bacterial pyrolysis products. This unknown was identified as 2-methylpyrimidine. This pyrolysis product was only found in appreciable amounts in samples from other saline systems but not in freshwater systems analyzed as points of comparison for the system of concern. Further investigation confirmed the source of 2-methylpyrimidine to be ectoine, a compound produced by halophilic bacteria as a compatible solute for osmoadaptation. Pyrolysis GC/MS was shown to be a useful tool to indicate the presence of ectoine in halophilic bacteria.},

@article{Nierop2005c,
abstract = {A collection of tannins extracted from various plant species was subjected to thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The products obtained included 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes, derived from A rings of condensed tannins (CTs), and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, and derivatives as major products from the B ring. 1,2,4-Tri- and two tetramethoxybenzenes were also detected in most analyses. Correlation analyses revealed that they were derived from the B ring, with 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene being derived from a procyanidin (PC) B ring and 1,2,3,5-tetramethoxybenzene from a prodelphinidin (PD) ring. Tannins from species that contained both CT and hydrolyzable tannin (HT) produced mainly permethylated gallic acid moieties upon THM, and the products derived from CTs were less abundant. Most likely, the ester-bound HTs are more easily transmethylated than the cleavage and methylation of the C-C and C-O linked CTs. Statistical analyses of the THM products and 13C NMR data of the tannins showed good correlations between the B ring hydroxylation and the di- and trimethoxybenzenes observed. Using the ratio of the methyl esters of 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid only provided good correlations of the percent PC as well. Furthermore, the 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzenes may serve as good markers of tannins in plant, soil, sediment or other samples as analyzed by THM.},

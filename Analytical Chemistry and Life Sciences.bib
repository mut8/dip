@article{Lindblom2009a,
abstract = {The perspective of this work is to develop a model, which can be used to better understand and optimize wastewater treatment plants that are able to remove xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs) in combination with removal of traditional pollutants. Results from dynamic experiments conducted with the endocrine disrupting XOC bisphenol-A (BPA) in an activated sludge process with real wastewater were used to hypothesize an ASM-based process model including aerobic growth of a specific BPA-degrading microorganism and sorption of BPA to sludge. A parameter estimation method was developed, which simultaneously utilizes steady-state background concentrations and dynamic step response data, as well as conceptual simplifications of the plant configuration. Validation results show that biodegradation of BPA is sensitive to operational conditions before and during the experiment and that the proposed model structure is capable of capturing important characteristics of the observed BPA removal, thus increasing the potential for generalizing knowledge obtained from plant specific experiments.},

@article{Carvalho2004,
abstract = {A model for the biodegradation of non-ionic surfactants in an activated sludge system during acclimatisation was developed, based on respirometric and titrimetric experimental data. The data were obtained in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) using a non-ionic surfactant as sole carbon source and sludge previously acclimatised to a different surfactant. The model was successfully applied to successive SBR-cycles of sludge acclimatisation processes subjected to two ethoxylated surfactants. The model was validated using the corresponding total organic carbon data. The evolution of the model parameters along the acclimatisation process was examined. An acclimatisation model was developed using the evolution of two of these parameters (affinity constant and inhibition constant), supported by two independently calculated acclimatisation indicators. This acclimatisation model was then applied to determine an optimal surfactant concentration sequence to feed non-acclimatised sludge during a period of 41 days, in order to induce pre-acclimatisation to this surfactant before it replaces another one in the wastewater. The model was also useful in the economical assessment of this and alternative procedures to cope with frequent changes in activated sludge feed composition.},
